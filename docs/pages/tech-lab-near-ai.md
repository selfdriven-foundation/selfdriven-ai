# selfdriven AI & NEAR AI Integration  
How the selfdriven ecosystem — including **selfdriven.ai**, SDN, Octomics, and your Cardano-first model — can plug into the NEAR AI stack.

---

# 1. Why NEAR AI fits naturally with selfdriven

Your ecosystem already uses:
- SSI (KERI, ACDC, VCs, DID methods)  
- Cardano as trust + governance + treasury anchor  
- Progressive self-actuation and community operating models  
- AI assistants (learning, governance, org, community)  
- Octomics (proof-of-activity)  
- Multi-interface architecture (Human, AI, On-Chain, Infra)

**NEAR AI fills two gaps you don’t currently have:**

### **A. Agent runtime**
- Persistent autonomous agents  
- Delegated keys / delegated permissions  
- Automated execution of tasks  
- Wallet-capable agents

### **B. Verifiable inference**
- Proofs that an AI model gave a specific output  
- Compute marketplace  
- Trustable workflows for high-integrity tasks

**Cardano stays the trust anchor.  
NEAR becomes the execution layer.  
selfdriven.ai becomes the mind.**

# 2. How selfdriven.ai connects directly to NEAR AI

### **selfdriven.ai handles:**
- Intent analysis  
- Role-based assistants  
- Knowledge & evidence flows  
- Plans, tasks, decisions  
- Human ↔ AI interaction  
- VC transformations  
- KERI/DID logic

### **NEAR AI handles:**
- Automated actions  
- Smart-agent operations  
- Verifiable inference  
- Delegated authority  
- Micro-execution  
- Compute tasks

**selfdriven.ai = Mind  
NEAR AI = Body**

NEAR AI agents act on the outputs of selfdriven.ai.

# 🔧 4. Practical examples of what you can build

### **1. Governance Assistants**
- Draft proposals  
- Summaries  
- Scenario modelling  
- Budget checking  
- Publish proofs on Midnight

### **2. Community Assistants**
- Onboarding flows  
- Wallet creation guidance  
- VC issuance  
- Learning plans  
- Intent routing to SDN

### **3. Org Operations Agents**
- Schedule tasks  
- Update SDN records  
- Settle small payments  
- Maintain activity logs  
- Proactively surface risks

### **4. Octomics Workers**
- Track activity events  
- Generate PoA  
- Submit proofs to NEAR agents  
- Anchor results to Cardano

---

# 🧬 5. Octomics × NEAR AI

**Enhances Octomics with:**
- Agent-collected activity  
- Verifiable inference  
- Proof-of-Workload  
- Proof-of-Engagement  
- Proof-of-Contribution

NEAR can run:
- Octomics verifiers  
- Event collectors  
- Reward calculators  
- ZK summarizers → Midnight contracts

---

# 🌐 6. How selfdriven.network (SDN) plugs in

NEAR AI agents can call SDN endpoints as event producers or processors.

### Example Flow
1. A member triggers an intent  
2. SDN parses → selfdriven.ai Assistant  
3. Assistant generates plan + tasks  
4. NEAR AI agent executes low-level tasks  
5. Cardano stores final proofs (VC, DID event, CIP-68 metadata)

This matches your “intents → actions → proofs” loop.

---

# 🔥 7. High-value integration modules (start here)

### **1. NEAR-powered Community Assistant Agent**
Executes:
- notifications  
- scheduling  
- content updates  
- member nudges  
- activity capture  

### **2. Org Assistant with delegated NEAR wallet**
Handles:
- micro-payments  
- contract calls  
- task automation  
- public commitments  

### **3. Verifiable inference → Midnight adaptor**
- NEAR inference proofs  
- ZK compression  
- Midnight verifier contract  

### **4. Cross-chain Identity Bridge**
- did:key / KERI → NEAR binding  
- NEAR → Cardano trust layer  

### **5. Octomics Agent**
- Collect events  
- Verify claims  
- Publish PoA proofs  
- Update Cardano CIP-68 state

# Summary

**selfdriven (ecosystem)**  
= philosophical framework + governance + identity + community operating system.

**selfdriven.ai**  
= intelligence, assistants, intents, comprehension, planning, transformation.

**NEAR AI**  
= agent execution engine + verifiable inference + “body for AI agents.”

**Cardano + Midnight**  
= trust, governance, SSI anchors, treasury, constitutional accountability.

Together they form a **multi-chain, agent-powered OS for communities and cooperatives**, with:
- trustworthy identity  
- verifiable AI  
- automated execution  
- accountable governance  
- composable community infrastructure  

Everything stays aligned with your “Progressive Self-Actuation” model.
