# When to Wait vs When to Build Framework

*A simple decision framework for rapidly, AI based, changing society.*

## 1. First question: is tech improvement outpacing your execution?

If AI capability is growing faster than you can build manually, waiting may be optimal.

**Indicators**
- monthly frontier jumps
- new model releases invalidate work
- tools automating what you’re building
- your roadmap looks manual + labour heavy

**Lean toward waiting**

## 2. Are you capturing something *that compounds* over time?

Some assets compound regardless of tech shifts:

- audience
- brand
- trust
- governance position
- community adoption
- partnerships
- data you have permission to use
- distribution channels

**Build these immediately**

## 3. Is there a land-grab or a standards moment happening?

Early movers win when:
- standards are forming
- governance rules are being written
- ecosystems are emerging
- protocols and norms are still flexible

**Move now**
(even if technology isn’t ready)

## 4. Will your work be leapfrogged soon?
Classic “Wait Equation” logic:
- if waiting 6 months makes the job 10× easier,
- do not build the hard version today.

Ask:
**Will this be trivial later?**
If yes → wait.

## 5. Can you build a *thin layer* now?
Instead of a big build:
- MVP
- integration layer
- proof-of-concept
- tiny demo
- community test

**Build something extremely small**
→ keeps you in motion without sinking cost

## 6. Reverse question:
What becomes harder if you wait?

Things that get harder later:
- trust
- coordination
- community memory
- legitimacy
- governance seats
- reputation
- distribution relationships

**Build these now**

# Cheat-Sheet

| Asset type | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Tech implementation | Likely wait |
| Governance / standards | Build now |
| Community | Build now |
| Partnerships | Build now |
| Data rights | Build now |
| Manual tools | Wait |
| AI-automatable work | Wait |
| Distribution | Build |
| Brand | Build |
| Proof-of-concept | Small now |

## Single rule

**If AI will do this better than you soon → wait.**
**If humans and relationships are the advantage → build.**

**The Mars analogy**

If you want to go to Mars, and every year rockets get ~10% faster, should you:
- launch now (taking longer), OR
- wait a few years and travel much faster?

If you leave now, a future mission might actually pass you on the way and arrive first.

This creates a weird implication:
**sometimes waiting gets you there sooner.**

---

T = W + \frac{D}{S(t + W)}

- W = how long you wait for better tech
- D = task size (distance to Mars, capability gap, etc.)
- S(t) = speed/capability you’ll have at time t
- T = total arrival time
