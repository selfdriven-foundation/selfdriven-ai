## selfdriven AI Usage in Practice

### Implemented using a combination of:
- [octology](https://octology.io/) - definitions, constraints
- [selfdriven.network](https://selfdriven.network/) - Human, AI, SSI, Entity Interfaces
- [selfdriven Progessive Self-Actuation Framework](https://onboarding.selfdriven.foundation/framework/) - Community 5W1H Sheet

### Community-Based Intelligence

**Community-Based Intelligence** is designed to help communities capture, organise, and activate their collective knowledge.

Each community begins by gathering its key documents — such as charters, plans, and discussions — and creating a **Vector Store** through the **selfdriven.network AI Interface**. This enables the community’s data to become machine-readable and contextually searchable.

A **Community Assistant** is then generated, equipped with a “System Card” derived from the *Community 5W1H Sheet*. This ensures the Assistant understands the community’s purpose, principles, and context.

Community members, authenticated via their **selfdriven Identity (SSI DID)**, can start conversations with the Assistant through the **selfdriven Human Interface** (the app). These interactions allow members to ask questions, explore insights, and co-create knowledge.

When appropriate, conversations can be shared with other community members — such as facilitators or practitioners — to enable collaboration, mentorship, or collective problem-solving.
