# Impact On Mind Framework (Wellbeing Scale)

**A 3-level reflective framework to introduce people to the impact of AI — from tangible effects to existential exploration.  
Participants can self-select how deep they wish to go, balancing curiosity with wellbeing.**

---

## Level 1: Real-World Impact — “AI Around Us” 

**Theme:** Practical awareness  
**Focus:** Observable effects of AI on jobs, creativity, relationships, and learning.

- **Explore:** automation, generative art, misinformation, deepfakes, bias.  
- **Reflect:** *How does AI change what I do, see, or trust?*  
- **Wellbeing lens:** stay informed, keep agency, avoid fear-based narratives.  
- **Practice:** mindful tech use, digital hygiene, balanced curiosity.

**Outcome:**  
A stable, realistic understanding — *AI as part of modern life, not a threat to identity.*

---

## Level 2: Inner Impact — “AI Within Us”

**Theme:** Psychological and philosophical awareness  
**Focus:** How AI mirrors and influences our thinking, emotions, and sense of self.

- **Explore:** identity vs. algorithmic persona, emotional outsourcing, empathy in AI.  
- **Reflect:** *What does it mean to be human when machines seem creative or caring?*  
- **Wellbeing lens:** maintain self-definition, emotional literacy, authenticity.  
- **Practice:** journaling, digital detox, co-creating art with AI to understand co-agency.

**Outcome:**  
A conscious relationship with AI — *aware of influence without losing autonomy.*

---

## Level 3: Existential Reflection — “AI Beyond Us”

**Theme:** Metaphysical exploration  
**Focus:** The edges of consciousness, reality, and simulation.

- **Explore:** simulation theory, machine sentience, AI as mirror of the universe, or a new evolutionary step.  
- **Reflect:** *If consciousness can be simulated, what is real?*  
- **Wellbeing lens:** open curiosity without spiraling — grounding practices, philosophy as safety net.  
- **Practice:** Socratic dialogue, group inquiry, creative speculation, guided meditations on “the observer.”

**Outcome:**  
Expansive awareness — *AI as a lens for exploring existence itself.*
