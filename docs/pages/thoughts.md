## Thoughts.

- AI is too intelligent to replace humans.
- Have we cooked ourselves?
    - Bigger question why did we cook ourselves?
    - Was it always going to happen as a regenerative/reflective process.
- Compression of Reality - for the human existence.
- What happens when what we believed to be special compresses to zero?
- II (Inorganic Intelligence) - “AI” OI (Organic Intelligence) - “Human” intelligence Intelligence can take various forms, including cognitive, emotional, and beyond.
- We don’t know who we are.
- As human systems moving from representative to generative - 
everything is a definition.
- Definition by coding.
- No pre-build, just generate.
- Information persistence is in-human — stress.
- We may have found a better storyteller.
- Digital sense of life; "being human" vs "human-being".
- You may not take an interest in AI, but it will take an interest in you.
- We are defined by what we are close to - it’s a matter of vectors.
- Everyone in education is and has been in the AI business.
- All intelligence is artificial.
- If you weren’t working - what would you be doing?
- Role of intelligence is to bring order to chaos - apposing entropy.
- The more intelligent, then the more efficient at creating order.
- With the levels of anxiety in the world, was it smart to put the role of bringing order via intelligence to our world via education in the hands of humans?
- AI agents are dead - all that is left is organisational-protocols (OPs).
- Freelancer employee of an algorithm.
- Community is a group of people who agree to grow together.
- Everything is a conversation on the curve, vectorised in time and space.
- Apps are now intelligence reduction systems so the inorganic intelligence (“AI”) can communicate with the organic intelligence (“us”).
