# Improving the Insurance Claims Ecosystem for Better Consumer Experience

## Introduction  
Insurance claims processing is a critical “moment of truth” for consumers – the speed, fairness, and transparency of a claim can make or break customer trust ([The $100 Billion Opportunity for Generative AI in P&C Claims Handling | Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/insights/100-billion-dollar-opportunity-for-generative-ai-in-p-and-c-claims-handling/#:~:text=Claims%20is%20where%20the%20rubber,years%2C%20costs%20have%20been%20climbing)). In Australia, recent extreme weather disasters (especially the 2022 floods) exposed significant shortcomings in how insurers handle claims, prompting government inquiries and industry introspection. This report examines the challenges identified in the Australian government’s *Inquiry into Insurers’ Responses to 2022 Major Floods Claims*, the Insurance Council of Australia’s (ICA) responses over the past two years, and explores innovations that can enhance claims processing and consumer satisfaction. We discuss new technologies – from mobile apps and generative AI to blockchain (with a focus on Cardano) – and how they are being applied in insurance. We also consider regulatory factors in adopting these tools in Australia and propose how such improvements can be delivered as a service model. Throughout, case studies illustrate how companies are implementing these advancements.

## Challenges in Claims Processing: Lessons from the 2022 Floods Inquiry  
The 2022 catastrophic floods in South-East Queensland and Northern New South Wales led to over 300,000 claims and became Australia’s costliest extreme weather event ([Insurers welcome Parliamentary report into 2022 flood response - Insurance Council of Australia](https://insurancecouncil.com.au/resource/insurers-welcome-parliamentary-report-into-2022-flood-response/#:~:text=The%20four%20flood%20events%20across,incurred%20from%20just%20one%20event)). The parliamentary inquiry into insurers’ responses found *serious shortcomings* in claims handling. Key challenges identified included:  

- **Inconsistent and Unfair Outcomes:** The inquiry heard of *inconsistent decision-making*, where neighbors with similar flood damage received different claim outcomes from their insurers ([

Some claims were *badly mishandled*, leading to perceptions of unfairness. Initial cash settlement offers were often *too low*, leaving policyholders short-changed ([

- **Excessive Delays:** Many customers experienced long delays in claim assessment and repairs. More than two years after the floods, *many people still can’t go home*, highlighting the extreme slowness in rebuilding and settlements for some victims ([

Such delays caused significant emotional, mental health, and financial strain on claimants.  

- **Poor Communication and Support:** The stress of navigating claims was exacerbated by poor communication. Some customers felt *traumatized by their interactions* with insurers ([Insurers welcome Parliamentary report into 2022 flood response - Insurance Council of Australia](https://insurancecouncil.com.au/resource/insurers-welcome-parliamentary-report-into-2022-flood-response/#:~:text=While%20they%20were%20small%20in,their%20interactions%20with%20their%20insurer)). In many cases, policyholders had to chase insurers for updates, and lack of clear information led to frustration. This aligns with broader industry findings that when customers must *“track down a status update”* by phone and repeat information, their satisfaction plummets ([Insurers still struggle to deliver seamless digital experience – report | Insurance Business America](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/technology/insurers-still-struggle-to-deliver-seamless-digital-experience--report-469117.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDigital%20communications%20in%20the%20form,%E2%80%9D)) ([Insurers still struggle to deliver seamless digital experience – report | Insurance Business America](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/technology/insurers-still-struggle-to-deliver-seamless-digital-experience--report-469117.aspx#:~:text=,who%20said%20that%20claim%20reporting)).  

- **Technical Policy Issues:** Complex policy wording and strict exclusions created additional hurdles. The inquiry noted confusion over terms like *“rainfall runoff” vs “flood”*, and how claims were denied due to fine print. Insurers sometimes relied on expert reports (e.g. hydrologists or engineers) to deny claims even when the cause linkage was tenuous ([

](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/About_the_House_News/Media_Releases/Flood_insurance_inquiry_reports_on_industry_failures#:~:text=,for%20example)). Many policyholders were shocked to have claims denied for *pre-existing damage or maintenance issues* in parts of the home they could not reasonably have known about (for example, rotten *house stumps* revealed only after floodwaters subsided) ([

This left customers feeling insurance was a *“lottery”* if an unknown pre-existing issue could void their coverage ([

- **Inadequate Temporary Accommodation:** For total loss or uninhabitable homes, insurers typically cover temporary accommodation up to a time or cost limit (often 12 months). The inquiry found this was often insufficient – the *guaranteed accommodation period fell short of actual rebuild times*, leaving families moving from motel to motel and even camping in sheds once the 12-month allowance expired while their homes were still under repair ([

This gap caused significant hardship for claimants who had nowhere to live during lengthy repair delays.  

These failures were characterized by the inquiry chair as a *“collective failure by insurers to meet their obligations”* after the 2022 floods ([

The report was tellingly titled **“Flood Failure to Future Fairness”**, signaling the need for sweeping changes ([

## Inquiry Recommendations and ICA’s Response  
To address the above challenges, the House Standing Committee on Economics made **86 recommendations** aimed at overhauling claims handling and consumer protection ([Insurers welcome Parliamentary report into 2022 flood response - Insurance Council of Australia](https://insurancecouncil.com.au/resource/insurers-welcome-parliamentary-report-into-2022-flood-response/#:~:text=The%20Insurance%20Council%20of%20Australia,to%202022%20major%20floods%20claims)). Key recommendations from the October 2024 inquiry report include:  

- **Stronger Regulation and Standards:** Register the General Insurance Code of Practice with ASIC (making it legally enforceable) and legislate standard definitions for key terms (e.g. *“rainfall runoff”, “storm surge”, “wear and tear”, “lack of maintenance”*) across all policies ([
	Flood insurance inquiry reports on industry failures
        
     – Parliament of Australia
](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/About_the_House_News/Media_Releases/Flood_insurance_inquiry_reports_on_industry_failures#:~:text=,to%20policyholders%20on%20any%20maintenance)). These steps seek to eliminate ambiguity and hold insurers accountable to consistent standards in claims.  

- **Fairer Claims Decisions:** Issue ASIC guidance to prevent insurers from denying claims *solely* based on an expert report that doesn’t definitively link damage to the claimed event ([
	Flood insurance inquiry reports on industry failures
        
     – Parliament of Australia
](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/About_the_House_News/Media_Releases/Flood_insurance_inquiry_reports_on_industry_failures#:~:text=,for%20example)). In other words, insurers shouldn’t hide behind inconclusive expert opinions to refuse payouts. Insurers must also give policyholders up-front guidance on maintenance obligations, and there should be a *“presumption of coverage”* if a loss is caused by something the homeowner couldn’t reasonably have maintained (such as hidden structural elements like stumps) ([

     – Parliament of Australia

- **Timely Processing:** Require insurers to accept or deny a claim within 12 months. If no decision is made in 12 months, the claim *must be accepted in full by default* ([
	Flood insurance inquiry reports on industry failures
        
     – Parliament of Australia
](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/About_the_House_News/Media_Releases/Flood_insurance_inquiry_reports_on_industry_failures#:~:text=maintenance%20would%20be%20infrequent%2C%20costly,of%20the%20Code%20of%20Practice)). This recommendation directly targets the extreme delays by imposing a hard deadline.  

- **Data Transparency:** Mandate that insurers report key claims management performance data to ASIC quarterly (and monthly after a disaster), and that this data (including any Code of Practice breaches) be published at insurer and brand level ([
	Flood insurance inquiry reports on industry failures
        
     – Parliament of Australia

Publicly visible metrics like claim acceptance rates, average settlement times, and complaints would create pressure to improve service.  

- **Improved Temporary Accommodation Cover:** The inquiry urged that insurers *extend temporary accommodation support by default until home repairs are complete*. Currently, many policies cap this at 12 months, which proved too short for major disasters ([

The committee argued insurers should bear the risk of longer rebuild times rather than forcing customers out early ([

It also recommended insurers give at least 3 months’ notice before ending accommodation payments ([

     – Parliament of Australia
](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/About_the_House_News/Media_Releases/Flood_insurance_inquiry_reports_on_industry_failures#:~:text=accommodation)).  

- **Addressing Uninsurability and Mitigation:** Recognizing that some areas face such high flood risk that insurance is unaffordable or unavailable, the report suggested government intervention for *uninsurable properties*. It recommended disclosing flood risk in property sale and rental processes, discouraging new development on high-risk floodplains (e.g. via banking regulations), improving building codes for resilience, extending hazard rating apps (like the Bushfire Resilience Rating app) to floods, and expanding home buyback/retrofit programs ([

](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/About_the_House_News/Media_Releases/Flood_insurance_inquiry_reports_on_industry_failures#:~:text=,risk%20properties)). It also said insurers should reduce premiums when owners invest in risk mitigation measures ([

The Australian insurance industry, through the ICA, has publicly acknowledged these issues and largely welcomed the recommendations. In an October 2024 news release, the ICA noted that while the vast majority of the 305,000+ flood claims were handled successfully, *“too many examples”* showed customers receiving poor service or even trauma from the process ([Insurers welcome Parliamentary report into 2022 flood response - Insurance Council of Australia](https://insurancecouncil.com.au/resource/insurers-welcome-parliamentary-report-into-2022-flood-response/#:~:text=While%20they%20were%20small%20in,their%20interactions%20with%20their%20insurer)). Insurers apologized to those let down and **“recommitted to ensuring service standards are improved through greater investment in people, tools and training.”** ([Insurers welcome Parliamentary report into 2022 flood response - Insurance Council of Australia](https://insurancecouncil.com.au/resource/insurers-welcome-parliamentary-report-into-2022-flood-response/#:~:text=their%20insurer)) 

Notably, **ICA’s Response and Actions (2023–2024):**  
- **Independent Review:** Even before the parliamentary inquiry commenced, the ICA had initiated its own independent review. In April 2023, it commissioned Deloitte to examine insurers’ response to the 2022 floods and recommend improvements ([ICA Statement - 19 August 2023 - Insurance Council of Australia](https://insurancecouncil.com.au/resource/ica-statement-19-august-2023/#:~:text=We%20acknowledge%20there%20is%20more,look%20forward%20to%20participating%20in)). This review (separate from the government inquiry) was intended to identify industry failings and “feed into” the inquiry’s work ([ICA Statement - 19 August 2023 - Insurance Council of Australia](https://insurancecouncil.com.au/resource/ica-statement-19-august-2023/#:~:text=We%20acknowledge%20there%20is%20more,look%20forward%20to%20participating%20in)). Deloitte’s report (titled *“After the Floods”*) provided numerous recommendations which the industry started acting upon in 2023. A follow-up progress report (*“After the floods – meeting the benchmark”*) released in late 2024 found insurers had made **“notable advancements”** and invested substantially to improve operations in line with recommendations ([

For example, many insurers upgraded systems and processes (some changes were already completed, while more transformative tech upgrades were still in progress) ([

However, progress varied by company – some moved faster than others, and work remained in areas like stress-testing claims operations, scaling up support for vulnerable customers, and improving data quality for internal oversight ([

- **Industry Adoption of Reforms:** By December 2024, the ICA reported the industry had accepted **78 of 187** recommendations from the combination of the inquiry and the independent review ([

](https://www.asiainsurancereview.com/News/ViewNewsLetterArticle/id/90841/Type/eDaily/Australia-Significant-progress-in-insurance-industry-revealed#:~:text=The%20ICA%20released%20the%20first,187%20recommendations%20across%20both%20reports)). Work was underway on many fronts. For instance, insurers (through ICA) began developing standardized definitions (for terms like maintenance/wear-and-tear) and better protocols for identifying and assisting vulnerable customers ([Insurers welcome Parliamentary report into 2022 flood response - Insurance Council of Australia](https://insurancecouncil.com.au/resource/insurers-welcome-parliamentary-report-into-2022-flood-response/#:~:text=year)). These align with the inquiry’s calls for clarity and fairness. The ICA also indicated it would engage with members on all the inquiry’s recommendations and the concurrent review of the General Insurance Code of Practice ([Insurers welcome Parliamentary report into 2022 flood response - Insurance Council of Australia](https://insurancecouncil.com.au/resource/insurers-welcome-parliamentary-report-into-2022-flood-response/#:~:text=The%20industry%20has%20already%20made,and%20handling%20of%20vulnerable%20customers)).  

- **Support for Key Reforms:** The ICA **“strongly supports”** recommendations aimed at easing cost pressures and protecting communities ([Insurers welcome Parliamentary report into 2022 flood response - Insurance Council of Australia](https://insurancecouncil.com.au/resource/insurers-welcome-parliamentary-report-into-2022-flood-response/#:~:text=The%20report%20provides%2086%20recommendations,disasters%20and%20enhancing%20consumer%20protections)). In particular, it backed proposals to remove state insurance stamp taxes (to reduce premiums) and to increase government investment in resilience and mitigation infrastructure ([Insurers welcome Parliamentary report into 2022 flood response - Insurance Council of Australia](https://insurancecouncil.com.au/resource/insurers-welcome-parliamentary-report-into-2022-flood-response/#:~:text=The%20ICA%20strongly%20supports%20those,from%20future%20extreme%20weather%20events)). ICA’s CEO, Andrew Hall, noted that getting the balance right between improving customer outcomes and not unduly raising premiums will be *“key to successful implementation”* of reforms ([Insurers welcome Parliamentary report into 2022 flood response - Insurance Council of Australia](https://insurancecouncil.com.au/resource/insurers-welcome-parliamentary-report-into-2022-flood-response/#:~:text=The%20ICA%20and%20its%20members,stakeholders%20on%20the%20report%E2%80%99s%20recommendations)). This reflects an industry caution: improvements must be sustainable and not make insurance unaffordable.  

- **Acknowledging Failures and Commitment:** Industry leaders have been frank about the shortcomings. *“Insurers acknowledge there were failures of systems, processes and resourcing in response to the extreme weather events of 2022,”* Hall said, adding that the industry is already taking action to address these challenges ([Insurers welcome Parliamentary report into 2022 flood response - Insurance Council of Australia](https://insurancecouncil.com.au/resource/insurers-welcome-parliamentary-report-into-2022-flood-response/#:~:text=just%20one%20event)). The ICA emphasized a commitment to work closely with government, regulators (ASIC, APRA), consumer groups and other stakeholders to implement changes that will lead to *better customer outcomes after disasters* ([Insurers welcome Parliamentary report into 2022 flood response - Insurance Council of Australia](https://insurancecouncil.com.au/resource/insurers-welcome-parliamentary-report-into-2022-flood-response/#:~:text=report%E2%80%99s%20recommendations%2C%20alongside%20the%20recommendations,General%20Insurance%20Code%20of%20Practice)).  

In summary, the inquiry spotlighted critical weaknesses in claims processing: inconsistent decisions, delay, poor communication, rigid policies, and under-resourced surge response. The ICA and insurers have responded with public support for reforms, initiated independent improvements (like the Deloitte review), and begun implementing changes such as system upgrades, policy clarity, and improved customer support. However, the pace of change is uneven and full restoration of consumer trust will require sustained effort. Technology innovations offer a promising avenue to accelerate and cement these improvements.

## Technological Innovations to Enhance Claims Processing and Consumer Satisfaction  
Addressing the above challenges is not only about policy and process – technology can play a transformative role in improving speed, consistency, and customer experience in claims handling. Three areas of innovation stand out: **mobile applications, generative AI, and blockchain (Cardano)**. These tools can streamline workflows, increase transparency, and empower consumers, ultimately leading to faster settlements and higher satisfaction. Below we analyze each and provide case study examples of their implementation.

### Digital Claims Platforms and Mobile Apps  
Modern insurance customers expect the convenience of digital self-service. Mobile apps and online claim portals are now common, but their effectiveness varies. A well-designed claims app can significantly ease the customer’s journey: it allows users to **lodge claims 24/7**, upload photos or videos of damage on the spot, track claim status in real-time, and communicate with their insurer without lengthy calls. This immediacy and transparency can reduce anxiety after a loss.  

However, industry research shows many insurers still struggle to deliver a truly *“seamless”* digital claims experience. According to J.D. Power’s 2023 Claims Digital Experience Study, only **41% of customers** fully agreed that digital tools met their expectations for efficiency and keeping them informed ([Insurers still struggle to deliver seamless digital experience – report | Insurance Business America](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/technology/insurers-still-struggle-to-deliver-seamless-digital-experience--report-469117.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%9CCustomers%20have%20an%20expectation%20that,%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D)). In practice, one-third of claimants had to follow up by phone even after using digital channels, often to get updates or clarify next steps ([Insurers still struggle to deliver seamless digital experience – report | Insurance Business America](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/technology/insurers-still-struggle-to-deliver-seamless-digital-experience--report-469117.aspx#:~:text=,who%20said%20that%20claim%20reporting)). Those additional calls and repetitive inquiries caused satisfaction scores to drop sharply (by 78 points on a 1000-point scale) compared to customers whose digital updates answered all their questions ([Insurers still struggle to deliver seamless digital experience – report | Insurance Business America](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/technology/insurers-still-struggle-to-deliver-seamless-digital-experience--report-469117.aspx#:~:text=,who%20said%20that%20claim%20reporting)). The lesson is clear: simply offering an app is not enough – it must be **comprehensive and responsive** to avoid customers reverting to call centers (and frustration).  

Key features that drive success in mobile claims apps include:  

- **Proactive Status Updates:** Push notifications or texts that keep the customer updated on claim progress (e.g. “Assessor scheduled for Tuesday” or “Repair approved, waiting for contractor”). J.D. Power found that personalized texts or app notifications that keep customers informed *dramatically improve satisfaction*, and reduce the need for customers to “chase” information ([Insurers still struggle to deliver seamless digital experience – report | Insurance Business America](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/technology/insurers-still-struggle-to-deliver-seamless-digital-experience--report-469117.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDigital%20communications%20in%20the%20form,%E2%80%9D)) ([Insurers still struggle to deliver seamless digital experience – report | Insurance Business America](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/technology/insurers-still-struggle-to-deliver-seamless-digital-experience--report-469117.aspx#:~:text=,who%20said%20that%20claim%20reporting)).  

- **Ease of Use:** Intuitive interfaces to submit a claim with guided steps. The app can use phone features (camera, location) to gather info. If uploading photos of damage, the process should be simple and quick. Only **35% of customers** in the study said the digital estimation process was “very easy” ([Insurers still struggle to deliver seamless digital experience – report | Insurance Business America](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/technology/insurers-still-struggle-to-deliver-seamless-digital-experience--report-469117.aspx#:~:text=in%20the%20process%20and%20keep,%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D)), indicating room for improvement in user experience design. Clear instructions and in-app guidance (like examples of acceptable photos, or a live chat assistant to help) can boost usability.  

- **Two-Way Communication:** In-app chat or messaging with claims officers can resolve questions without a phone call. If a customer has a question about a document or needs to provide additional info, doing this through the app keeps a unified record and is convenient. 

- **Document Access:** Customers should be able to easily access their policy details, coverage, and any letters or determinations via the app. This transparency helps them understand decisions and next steps, reducing confusion. 

Several insurers have reported positive outcomes from digitizing their claims process. For example, digital-first insurer **Lemonade (US)** allows customers to file claims through a smartphone app guided by an AI chatbot. In many cases, its system approves simple property claims almost instantly – their AI “claims bot” can pay out within minutes if fraud checks pass. This kind of real-time settlement is a benchmark for convenience (though reserved for low-complexity claims). Traditional insurers are also investing in app-based experiences. In Australia, the major insurers (IAG, Suncorp, Allianz, etc.) all offer claims lodgment via web or app. The focus now is on closing the loop so that once a claim is lodged, digital channels keep the customer informed throughout **without requiring them to call for updates**. When done correctly, digital self-service not only cuts down processing time but also improves customer sentiment by making the process feel under *their* control. As one expert noted, if customers can manage their claim “without a lot of effort, [they] become more satisfied – even when repair times are longer than ever” ([Insurers still struggle to deliver seamless digital experience – report | Insurance Business America](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/technology/insurers-still-struggle-to-deliver-seamless-digital-experience--report-469117.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAcross%20all%20of%20our%20insurance,Power)). In other words, transparency and communication ease the pain of unavoidable delays.

### Generative AI and Automation in Claims  
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) – typified by advanced language models like ChatGPT – is emerging as a game-changer in insurance operations. Claims handling, which involves heavy documentation and case-by-case communication, is *“fertile ground”* for GenAI adoption ([The $100 Billion Opportunity for Generative AI in P&C Claims Handling | Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/insights/100-billion-dollar-opportunity-for-generative-ai-in-p-and-c-claims-handling/#:~:text=,organizational%20change%20and%20new%20capabilities)). By leveraging GenAI and related automation, insurers can greatly speed up processes, reduce manual workload, and even improve decision consistency. Crucially, these efficiencies can translate into a better customer experience through faster responses and more accurate outcomes.

**Efficiency and Cost Savings:** Claims is one of the costliest insurance functions due to the large staff required and complex workflows ([The $100 Billion Opportunity for Generative AI in P&C Claims Handling | Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/insights/100-billion-dollar-opportunity-for-generative-ai-in-p-and-c-claims-handling/#:~:text=Claims%20is%20where%20the%20rubber,years%2C%20costs%20have%20been%20climbing)). GenAI offers the promise to *“bend the curve”* on these costs after years of only incremental gains from earlier tech ([The $100 Billion Opportunity for Generative AI in P&C Claims Handling | Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/insights/100-billion-dollar-opportunity-for-generative-ai-in-p-and-c-claims-handling/#:~:text=Advances%20in%20generative%20artificial%20intelligence,catching%20exceptions%20and%20leakage%20faster)). A 2024 analysis by Bain & Company estimated that, at scale, GenAI could reduce loss adjustment expenses (claims handling costs) by **20–25%** and cut leakage (erroneous or fraudulent payouts) by **30–50%**, potentially creating over **$100 billion in value** globally when benefits to both insurers and customers are considered ([The $100 Billion Opportunity for Generative AI in P&C Claims Handling | Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/insights/100-billion-dollar-opportunity-for-generative-ai-in-p-and-c-claims-handling/#:~:text=,organizational%20change%20and%20new%20capabilities)). Early pilots support this potential: one insurer reported a **50% productivity increase** on certain claims tasks by using GenAI to automate form-filling, summarizing claim notes, and drafting customer communications ([The $100 Billion Opportunity for Generative AI in P&C Claims Handling | Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/insights/100-billion-dollar-opportunity-for-generative-ai-in-p-and-c-claims-handling/#:~:text=Many%20companies%20have%20begun%20to,generative%20AI%20for%20coverage%20validation)). Another saw a *10–20 minute reduction per claim* in processing time by using AI to validate coverage for each claim ([The $100 Billion Opportunity for Generative AI in P&C Claims Handling | Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/insights/100-billion-dollar-opportunity-for-generative-ai-in-p-and-c-claims-handling/#:~:text=transcription%20to%20fill%20out%20forms%2C,generative%20AI%20for%20coverage%20validation)). These time savings mean customers get answers and settlements faster. 

**Use Cases in Claims:** Generative AI can be applied at multiple stages of the claims journey:  
- *Intake and FNOL (First Notice of Loss):* AI chatbots can converse with customers to gather initial claim information in natural language, guiding them through reporting an incident. Instead of filling a static form, a customer could simply *describe what happened*, and the AI will extract the necessary details and even fill out internal forms automatically ([Generative AI in Insurance: Key 7 Use Cases - Aisera](https://aisera.com/blog/chatgpt-generative-ai-in-insurance/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20you%20can%20develop,questions%20about%20policy%20coverage)). Voice-to-text capabilities can transcribe phone conversations or voice notes from customers and populate claim files ([The $100 Billion Opportunity for Generative AI in P&C Claims Handling | Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/insights/100-billion-dollar-opportunity-for-generative-ai-in-p-and-c-claims-handling/#:~:text=Many%20companies%20have%20begun%20to,generative%20AI%20for%20coverage%20validation)). This reduces the burden on call centers and ensures no detail is missed.  

- *Documentation and Analysis:* Claims often require reviewing police reports, medical reports, repair quotes, etc. GenAI excels at digesting unstructured data – it can read through lengthy documents and produce a concise summary or highlight key facts for the adjuster. For instance, an AI can summarize a medical report to relevant bullet points for a personal injury claim, saving an adjuster considerable time. It can also cross-verify details: one Asia-Pacific insurer used an AI to quickly check policy coverage against the claim details, catching mismatches and ensuring decisions (approve/deny) align with the contract, which improved accuracy and reduced *coverage-related leakage* (paying for things not actually covered) ([The $100 Billion Opportunity for Generative AI in P&C Claims Handling | Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/insights/100-billion-dollar-opportunity-for-generative-ai-in-p-and-c-claims-handling/#:~:text=transcription%20to%20fill%20out%20forms%2C,generative%20AI%20for%20coverage%20validation)).  

- *Communication and Status Updates:* Drafting letters and emails is another area. GenAI can draft customer-friendly communications for claim updates, request for information, or explanations of decisions, which human staff can then review and send. This not only speeds up correspondence but can standardize quality. A South American insurer’s pilot involved an AI chatbot to assist claim agents in answering customer queries, as well as auto-generation of summary reports and emails to customers ([The $100 Billion Opportunity for Generative AI in P&C Claims Handling | Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/insights/100-billion-dollar-opportunity-for-generative-ai-in-p-and-c-claims-handling/#:~:text=Many%20companies%20have%20begun%20to,generative%20AI%20for%20coverage%20validation)). This resulted in much faster response times and more consistent messaging.  

- *Assisting Human Adjusters:* Rather than replacing humans, GenAI often serves as a **copilot** for claim handlers. For example, Australia’s **Suncorp Group** has deployed an internal GenAI tool on their cloud platform that acts as a single knowledge source for each claim. It aggregates all relevant information – customer communications, assessor reports, builder quotes, claim status, next steps – into one view for the claims officer ([Suncorp moves from AI experimentation to full-scale production - Cloud - Software - Financial Services - iTnews](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/suncorp-moves-from-ai-experimentation-to-full-scale-production-613827#:~:text=longer)) ([Suncorp moves from AI experimentation to full-scale production - Cloud - Software - Financial Services - iTnews](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/suncorp-moves-from-ai-experimentation-to-full-scale-production-613827#:~:text=According%20to%20Price%20%2C%20the,a%20%E2%80%9Csingle%20view%20of%20claims%E2%80%9D)). Instead of toggling between multiple systems and reading through files (which could take 30+ minutes before a customer call), staff have the info at their fingertips, prepared by the AI ([Suncorp moves from AI experimentation to full-scale production - Cloud - Software - Financial Services - iTnews](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/suncorp-moves-from-ai-experimentation-to-full-scale-production-613827#:~:text=%E2%80%9C,that%20annoying%20work%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)). Suncorp reports that this *“insurance claim tool”* (powered by Azure OpenAI) cut the time to review a claim by **5 to 30 minutes** per claim, depending on complexity ([Suncorp moves from AI experimentation to full-scale production - Cloud - Software - Financial Services - iTnews](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/suncorp-moves-from-ai-experimentation-to-full-scale-production-613827#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThey%20don%27t%20have%20to%20go,%E2%80%9D)) ([Suncorp moves from AI experimentation to full-scale production - Cloud - Software - Financial Services - iTnews](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/suncorp-moves-from-ai-experimentation-to-full-scale-production-613827#:~:text=Suncorp%20said%20the%20claims%20tool,depending%20on%20the%20case%E2%80%99s%20complexity)). With 1,500 claims staff using it, the cumulative efficiency gains are enormous – and customers benefit through quicker updates and resolution. Suncorp’s CIO noted it’s *“exciting to see GenAI start to have a real impact for our customers and our people.”* ([Suncorp moves from AI experimentation to full-scale production - Cloud - Software - Financial Services - iTnews](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/suncorp-moves-from-ai-experimentation-to-full-scale-production-613827#:~:text=Suncorp%20said%20the%20claims%20tool,depending%20on%20the%20case%E2%80%99s%20complexity))  

- *Fraud Detection & Triage:* AI models can also flag anomalous patterns that might indicate fraud or require special attention, allowing insurers to triage claims more effectively. By analyzing historical claims data, AI can learn which claims are straightforward and which tend to become complex, enabling early routing of simple cases to fast-track settlement (even auto-approval in some instances) and complex cases to specialized teams. Zurich Insurance, for example, is feeding years of claims data into GenAI models to identify patterns and specific causes of loss to improve both underwriting and claims strategies ([The $100 Billion Opportunity for Generative AI in P&C Claims Handling | Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/insights/100-billion-dollar-opportunity-for-generative-ai-in-p-and-c-claims-handling/#:~:text=Many%20companies%20have%20begun%20to,to)). 

- *Virtual Assessment:* While not generative AI per se, computer vision AI deserves mention as a related innovation. Some insurers use AI to analyze photos of vehicle damage or property damage to estimate repair costs. This can supplement or even replace a physical adjuster’s inspection for certain minor claims, speeding up payouts. Generative AI can complement this by generating repair estimates in narrative form or interacting with customers to clarify damage descriptions.  

**Customer Experience Gains:** Beyond efficiency, GenAI can enhance the customer experience through personalization and on-demand service. AI-driven virtual assistants can be available 24/7 to answer questions like “What is the status of my claim?” or “What does my policy cover for this loss?” – providing immediate answers. As models become more advanced, these **virtual agents** can handle more complex conversations with empathy, escalating to humans only when necessary. Bain predicts *“human-like virtual assistants”* will be increasingly deployed for complex situations, tailored to an individual’s context ([The $100 Billion Opportunity for Generative AI in P&C Claims Handling | Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/insights/100-billion-dollar-opportunity-for-generative-ai-in-p-and-c-claims-handling/#:~:text=several%20themes%3A)). For example, if a customer’s home is badly damaged in a disaster, an AI assistant could walk them through emergency steps, coverage for temporary housing, how to document losses, etc., in a comforting and clear manner – essentially serving as a digital concierge during a stressful time. This kind of always-available support can significantly improve satisfaction, especially when call centers are overwhelmed during catastrophes.  

Real-world results are encouraging. In summary, generative AI stands to **speed up claims, reduce errors, and provide more responsive service**, addressing several issues highlighted by the 2022 floods experience (delays, inconsistent decisions, poor communication). It’s important to note that AI is typically deployed with human oversight – it augments human decision-makers to handle higher volume with consistency. Scaling these solutions will require insurers to invest in data quality, model training, and change management, but the outcome can be a more resilient claims process that keeps customers at the center.

### Blockchain and Smart Contracts (Cardano’s Potential)  
Blockchain technology offers another layer of innovation for insurance claims, especially in building trust, transparency, and automation through smart contracts. **Cardano**, as a third-generation blockchain platform known for its focus on security and scalability, is particularly interesting for insurance applications. By leveraging blockchain, insurers can create systems where *claims data and transactions are recorded immutably*, and certain payouts are triggered automatically when predefined conditions are met. This can greatly reduce fraud, disputes, and administrative overhead.

**Secure Data Sharing and Transparency:** One fundamental use of blockchain in insurance is as a *shared ledger* for claims. Instead of each party keeping their own (potentially inconsistent) records, all stakeholders – the insurer, the insured, brokers, adjusters, even regulators – could have access to a single source of truth about the claim’s status and history. For example, once a claim is lodged, each action (assignment to assessor, report uploaded, approval, payment) could be timestamped on a blockchain. This record is tamper-proof and transparent, which means **no one can later alter the timeline or details** of what occurred ([8 Blockchain Insurance Examples to Know | Built In](https://builtin.com/blockchain/blockchain-insurance-companies#:~:text=Smart%20contracts%20enable%20blockchain%20users,and%20hold%20both%20parties%20accountable)) ([8 Blockchain Insurance Examples to Know | Built In](https://builtin.com/blockchain/blockchain-insurance-companies#:~:text=smart%20contracts%20will%20create%20immutable,claims%20made%20to%20the%20company)). Such transparency can build trust: customers can verify that their claim isn’t being unjustly delayed or manipulated, and regulators can easily audit industry responses in near real-time. In the context of the 2022 floods, had there been a blockchain-based claims registry, issues like inconsistent outcomes might have been easier to detect and address (since data across insurers could be analyzed for discrepancies). Moreover, blockchain’s resilience (no single point of failure) could help during disaster surges – ensuring records aren’t lost and processing can continue even if one system goes down.

**Smart Contracts for Automated Payouts:** The most transformative aspect is using **smart contracts** – self-executing code on the blockchain that enforces the terms of an agreement. In insurance, a policy can be represented as a smart contract that holds funds (premium pool) and is programmed to pay out under certain conditions ([8 Blockchain Insurance Examples to Know | Built In](https://builtin.com/blockchain/blockchain-insurance-companies#:~:text=How%20Is%20Blockchain%20Used%20in,Insurance)) ([8 Blockchain Insurance Examples to Know | Built In](https://builtin.com/blockchain/blockchain-insurance-companies#:~:text=Smart%20contracts%20enable%20blockchain%20users,and%20hold%20both%20parties%20accountable)). This is especially suited for *parametric insurance*, where payouts are linked to an objective index or trigger (rather than a traditional assessment of damage). For instance, a flood insurance smart contract might be set to pay a fixed amount if a government flood gauge in the area records water levels above a threshold. When that event data (water level) is fed to the blockchain via an oracle (a trusted data source), the smart contract automatically executes the payout to the policyholder’s account – *no claim filing, no adjuster, no delays*. Such systems have already been prototyped: a recent project on Cardano (by partners including the broker Howden and oracle provider Charli3) has been exploring automated parametric insurance for events like earthquakes or crop damage. They outline how **policy terms can be encoded into smart contract logic**, with oracles continuously feeding real-world data (e.g., seismic readings, rainfall, crop yields) to trigger claims payments instantly when criteria are met ([CHARLI3 FIDA HOWDEN: Automated Parametric Insurance using Cardano blockchain](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/13/cardano-partners-enterprise-randd/charli3-fida-howden-automated-parametric-insurance-using-cardano-blockchain#:~:text=Likewise%2C%20the%20Fida%20Finance%20team,future%20to%20enable%20rapid%20scaling)) ([CHARLI3 FIDA HOWDEN: Automated Parametric Insurance using Cardano blockchain](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/13/cardano-partners-enterprise-randd/charli3-fida-howden-automated-parametric-insurance-using-cardano-blockchain#:~:text=2%20,Verification%20System)). While these projects are in pilot stages, they demonstrate the feasibility of *“programmed”* insurance that drastically reduces claims processing time and cost.

**Case in point:** The Lemonade Crypto Climate Coalition (a non-profit initiative by insurer Lemonade and partners) recently provided *parametric crop insurance* to nearly 7,000 small farmers in Kenya using blockchain and smart contracts. At the end of the insured growing season, **payouts were triggered automatically via smart contracts** for farmers in areas that suffered crop loss, *“without the need for filing claims, or for human adjusters,”* enabling rapid payment within days ([Nearly 7,000 Kenyan Farmers Protected by the Lemonade Crypto Climate Coalition  | Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230328005342/en/Nearly-7000-Kenyan-Farmers-Protected-by-the-Lemonade-Crypto-Climate-Coalition#:~:text=NEW%20YORK,timeline%20associated%20with%20the%20process)). This program runs on a blockchain platform (using smart contracts with oracle data for rainfall and yield); it not only sped up payouts that would normally take months, but also lowered administrative costs, allowing the product to be offered affordably to low-income farmers ([Nearly 7,000 Kenyan Farmers Protected by the Lemonade Crypto Climate Coalition  | Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230328005342/en/Nearly-7000-Kenyan-Farmers-Protected-by-the-Lemonade-Crypto-Climate-Coalition#:~:text=NEW%20YORK,and%20avoiding%20the%20often%20months)). This example underscores how blockchain solutions can improve fairness (everyone meeting the trigger gets paid uniformly), speed, and cost-efficiency in insurance – attributes equally desirable in the Australian context for disaster claims.

**Fraud Reduction and Trust:** Blockchain can also help combat fraud, a persistent issue that slows claims and increases costs. By having an *industry-wide, tamper-proof record* of claims, it’s easier to detect duplicate claims for the same loss or identify suspicious patterns (since data silos are broken down) ([8 Blockchain Insurance Examples to Know | Built In](https://builtin.com/blockchain/blockchain-insurance-companies#:~:text=of%20problems%20%E2%80%94%20including%20inefficiency%2C,made%20more%20stable%20and%20secure)) ([8 Blockchain Insurance Examples to Know | Built In](https://builtin.com/blockchain/blockchain-insurance-companies#:~:text=Blockchain%20optimizes%20the%20efficiency%2C%20security,even%20speeding%20up%20payment%20times)). For example, if a person tried to claim for the same damaged item with two different insurers, a shared ledger would immediately reveal the duplicate. Smart contracts can also be coded to require certain validations (like a parametric trigger or multi-party sign-off) before payout, making unauthorized or fraudulent payouts nearly impossible. A blockchain-based contract only executes when conditions are verifiably met, adding a layer of integrity to the process ([8 Blockchain Insurance Examples to Know | Built In](https://builtin.com/blockchain/blockchain-insurance-companies#:~:text=Smart%20contracts%20enable%20blockchain%20users,and%20hold%20both%20parties%20accountable)) ([8 Blockchain Insurance Examples to Know | Built In](https://builtin.com/blockchain/blockchain-insurance-companies#:~:text=smart%20contracts%20will%20create%20immutable,claims%20made%20to%20the%20company)). From the customer’s perspective, knowing that *“all data is transparently displayed”* and immutable can increase trust that their claim will be handled objectively ([8 Blockchain Insurance Examples to Know | Built In](https://builtin.com/blockchain/blockchain-insurance-companies#:~:text=smart%20contracts%20can%20track%20insurance,and%20hold%20both%20parties%20accountable)) ([8 Blockchain Insurance Examples to Know | Built In](https://builtin.com/blockchain/blockchain-insurance-companies#:~:text=If%20any%20false%20or%20fraudulent,in%20restitution%20to%20the%20harmed)). 

**Cardano’s Role:** Cardano is a blockchain platform distinguished by its research-driven approach and emphasis on formal verification (mathematically assuring code correctness). For insurance, this could be valuable when encoding policy logic into smart contracts – higher assurance that the contract will do exactly what’s intended, reducing errors. Cardano also supports metadata and identity features that can help link real-world identity to blockchain addresses, which is important in a regulated industry like insurance (to meet KYC/AML requirements). Additionally, Cardano’s proof-of-stake consensus is energy-efficient, aligning with insurers’ increasing focus on sustainability and ESG factors. While Ethereum has been the popular choice for many blockchain insurance pilots (e.g., AXA’s flight-delay insurance “Fizzy” used Ethereum smart contracts), Cardano’s growing ecosystem of oracles and DeFi infrastructure could support insurance use cases in a more scalable way, with potentially lower transaction fees and strong security. 

In summary, blockchain solutions (including those on Cardano) can introduce **automation, accuracy, and transparency** to claims processing. They are particularly well-suited for simplifying and speeding up payouts for well-defined events (like natural catastrophes), which directly addresses issues of delay and inconsistency raised by the floods inquiry. By recording every step immutably, they also enhance accountability – an insurer cannot retroactively alter claim records or easily deviate from agreed terms without it being evident on-chain. Challenges remain (such as integrating blockchain with legacy systems, oracle trust, and consumer accessibility), but real-world implementations show clear benefits. The technology can be used behind the scenes (the customer might not even know a blockchain is involved, just that their claim was fast and transparent) or as part of innovative new products like parametric covers that fill protection gaps.

## Case Study Insights: Implementations of Tech Innovations  
To illustrate how these innovations are being put into practice, we present a few case studies from the insurance industry (in Australia and globally) that demonstrate improved claims processing and customer experience:

- **Suncorp (Australia) – GenAI-Powered Claims Assistance:** Suncorp, one of Australia’s largest insurers, has embraced generative AI to improve its internal claims operations and customer support. In 2024, Suncorp partnered with Microsoft to scale up AI deployment across the enterprise, identifying around 120 AI use cases with 20 slated for near-term rollout ([Suncorp moves from AI experimentation to full-scale production - Cloud - Software - Financial Services - iTnews](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/suncorp-moves-from-ai-experimentation-to-full-scale-production-613827#:~:text=According%20to%20Suncorp%20CIO%20Adam,scale%20production%20across%20the%20enterprise%E2%80%9D)) ([Suncorp moves from AI experimentation to full-scale production - Cloud - Software - Financial Services - iTnews](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/suncorp-moves-from-ai-experimentation-to-full-scale-production-613827#:~:text=The%20insurer%20is%20actively%20exploring,for%20deployment%20by%20June%202025)). One of the first successes is an Azure OpenAI-based *“insurance claim tool”* used by ~1,500 Suncorp claims officers. This tool provides a **single view of each claim** by automatically gathering all relevant data – customer details, claim history, communications, documents, and policy info – and summarizing the status and next steps ([Suncorp moves from AI experimentation to full-scale production - Cloud - Software - Financial Services - iTnews](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/suncorp-moves-from-ai-experimentation-to-full-scale-production-613827#:~:text=longer)) ([Suncorp moves from AI experimentation to full-scale production - Cloud - Software - Financial Services - iTnews](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/suncorp-moves-from-ai-experimentation-to-full-scale-production-613827#:~:text=According%20to%20Price%20%2C%20the,a%20%E2%80%9Csingle%20view%20of%20claims%E2%80%9D)). By eliminating the need for staff to manually search through multiple systems, Suncorp cut the prep time before updating a customer by up to 30 minutes per claim ([Suncorp moves from AI experimentation to full-scale production - Cloud - Software - Financial Services - iTnews](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/suncorp-moves-from-ai-experimentation-to-full-scale-production-613827#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThey%20don%27t%20have%20to%20go,%E2%80%9D)) ([Suncorp moves from AI experimentation to full-scale production - Cloud - Software - Financial Services - iTnews](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/suncorp-moves-from-ai-experimentation-to-full-scale-production-613827#:~:text=Suncorp%20said%20the%20claims%20tool,depending%20on%20the%20case%E2%80%99s%20complexity)). For customers, this means when they call or inquire, the employee can immediately answer questions and provide informed updates, rather than saying “let me check and get back to you.” Suncorp also launched *SmartChat* bots to handle common inquiries and a *Smart Knowledge* system that gives instant answers to call center agents from the company’s knowledge base ([Suncorp moves from AI experimentation to full-scale production - Cloud - Software - Financial Services - iTnews](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/suncorp-moves-from-ai-experimentation-to-full-scale-production-613827#:~:text=Although%20the%20insurer%20has%20already,over%20the%20next%20three%20years)) ([Suncorp moves from AI experimentation to full-scale production - Cloud - Software - Financial Services - iTnews](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/suncorp-moves-from-ai-experimentation-to-full-scale-production-613827#:~:text=One%20it%20has%20already%20deployed,centre%20teams%20interacting%20with%20customers)). These AI-driven improvements have led to faster claim resolutions and higher customer satisfaction scores, demonstrating the real impact of GenAI in a major Australian insurer’s claims process.

- **Lemonade and Etherisc (Global) – Parametric Micro-Insurance via Blockchain:** The Lemonade Foundation, via its Crypto Climate Coalition, in collaboration with insurtech **Etherisc** and other partners, has implemented a blockchain-based insurance program for subsistence farmers in Africa. As mentioned, it provided **parametric crop insurance** for Kenyan farmers against drought and excessive rain. The innovation is that the entire process is handled by smart contracts on a blockchain platform: policies are issued and payouts are triggered automatically based on weather data and crop yield indices, all verified by decentralized oracles ([Nearly 7,000 Kenyan Farmers Protected by the Lemonade Crypto Climate Coalition  | Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230328005342/en/Nearly-7000-Kenyan-Farmers-Protected-by-the-Lemonade-Crypto-Climate-Coalition#:~:text=NEW%20YORK,timeline%20associated%20with%20the%20process)) ([Nearly 7,000 Kenyan Farmers Protected by the Lemonade Crypto Climate Coalition  | Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230328005342/en/Nearly-7000-Kenyan-Farmers-Protected-by-the-Lemonade-Crypto-Climate-Coalition#:~:text=,the%20region%2C%20with%20green%20grams)). In its first season (late 2022), nearly 7,000 farmers received protection and those affected received instant payouts at the end of the season, without needing to file claims ([Nearly 7,000 Kenyan Farmers Protected by the Lemonade Crypto Climate Coalition  | Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230328005342/en/Nearly-7000-Kenyan-Farmers-Protected-by-the-Lemonade-Crypto-Climate-Coalition#:~:text=NEW%20YORK,and%20avoiding%20the%20often%20months)) ([Nearly 7,000 Kenyan Farmers Protected by the Lemonade Crypto Climate Coalition  | Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230328005342/en/Nearly-7000-Kenyan-Farmers-Protected-by-the-Lemonade-Crypto-Climate-Coalition#:~:text=events%20during%20the%20recent%20growing,timeline%20associated%20with%20the%20process)). This case shows how blockchain can enable a sustainable *insurance-as-a-service* model in developing markets – drastically lowering overhead and proving the concept of **instant claims settlement**. While the context (small crop insurance) differs from home insurance in Australia, the underlying tech can be adapted. For example, a similar approach could be used for parametric flood insurance in Australia’s high-risk regions: using smart contracts on Cardano to automatically pay a predefined amount when an official flood gauge hits a certain level or when satellite data detects flooding in an area. Customers would receive emergency funds immediately, helping cover short-term costs and reducing the suffering from delays. This could operate alongside traditional insurance, offering a hybrid model of quick parametric payout plus slower full assessment for the remainder of the loss.

- **Allianz and Others – Mobile App Claims & AI globally:** Many leading insurers worldwide have developed end-to-end digital claims platforms. For instance, Allianz introduced a mobile app feature called “Image Capture” for auto claims – customers can take a guided series of photos of their damaged car, and AI algorithms provide an instant preliminary assessment of damage and recommend next steps (repair shop, etc.). In some cases, if the AI determines the damage is likely below a certain threshold, the claim can be approved immediately for a quick payout, improving cycle time dramatically. **Metromile** (a US auto insurer) leveraged telematics and AI to automatically initiate a claim if its sensors detected an accident, sometimes reaching out to the customer about a claim before they even contacted the insurer. **AXA**’s now-retired “Fizzy” product was a trailblazer in using Ethereum smart contracts to automate flight delay insurance: if a purchased flight was delayed beyond 2 hours, the policyholder’s Ethereum wallet was automatically paid a set compensation – no claim filing needed. These examples, while outside Australia, showcase the direction insurers are heading: combining **apps, IoT data, AI, and blockchain** to create faster, hassle-free claim experiences.

Each case study reinforces that technology is not just theoretical in insurance; when applied thoughtfully, it tangibly improves customer outcomes. Key takeaways are the importance of integrating these tools into a coherent service (for Suncorp, internal AI aiding human service; for Lemonade/Etherisc, a new service model reaching the underserved; for Allianz/AXA, added app features that delight customers). The next section discusses how such improvements might be delivered in the Australian insurance sector and what regulators will expect.

## Regulatory Considerations in Adopting New Technologies  
Innovating in financial services always requires navigating regulatory requirements, and insurance is no exception. In Australia, insurers are regulated by **ASIC** (Australian Securities and Investments Commission) for market conduct and consumer protection, and by **APRA** (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority) for financial safety and system stability. Additionally, the industry adheres to a Code of Practice (soon to be enforceable by law per the inquiry’s recommendation) and is subject to privacy laws. When integrating technologies like AI and blockchain, insurers must ensure compliance in areas of fairness, transparency, data protection, and operational resilience. Key regulatory considerations include:

- **Consumer Fairness and AI Ethics:** ASIC has signaled strong expectations that the use of AI (including GenAI) by insurers must be *responsible, fair, and transparent*. In a 2024 review, ASIC found nearly half of surveyed financial firms lacked policies on managing **AI-driven bias or fairness**, and even fewer had protocols for disclosing AI use to consumers ([

This is a concern because AI systems can inadvertently discriminate (for example, if a machine-learning claims model learned to reject claims from certain postcodes or demographics at a higher rate, it could violate anti-discrimination laws). ASIC’s chair warned of a **“governance gap”** if AI adoption outpaces firms’ risk controls ([

    ](https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-238mr-asic-warns-governance-gap-could-emerge-in-first-report-on-ai-adoption-by-licensees/#:~:text=%E2%80%98When%20it%20comes%20to%20balancing,competitive%20pressures%2C%E2%80%99%20Mr%20Longo%20said)). Insurers need to implement governance frameworks that cover AI – this means documented processes for testing AI for biased outcomes, oversight committees to review AI decisions, and clear accountability. If AI is used in claim decisions or customer interactions, insurers should consider informing customers (especially if an adverse decision is made primarily by an algorithm, the customer may have a right to a human review under consumer law or simply as best practice). The bottom line is regulators expect insurers to **apply existing obligations to new tech**: treating customers fairly (no unfair refusals or differing standards), providing suitable service, and handling complaints appropriately regardless of whether AI was involved ([

Notably, if a claim is denied (or payout reduced) due to an AI’s assessment (say an AI estimates low damage), the insurer must ensure that decision can be explained and justified to the customer in plain terms – otherwise they risk disputes in the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) and intervention by ASIC.

- **Data Privacy and Security:** Using mobile apps and blockchain involves collection and transmission of potentially sensitive personal data (photos of a home, identity details, claim history). Australia’s Privacy Act and possibly the Consumer Data Right (if extended to insurance in the future) mandate that customer data be handled with consent, used only for legitimate purposes, and stored securely. If insurers use cloud services or blockchain networks (which could be global), APRA will expect that they manage any outsourcing risks and ensure data remains protected (APRA’s CPS 234 standard requires robust information security for all sensitive data). Public blockchains like Cardano pose a unique challenge: by default, any data written on-chain is visible to all (even if pseudonymous). To comply, insurers would need to avoid putting personal identifiers or confidential info directly on a public ledger. Solutions include using the blockchain for transaction hashes or tokens representing claims, while keeping detailed personal data off-chain in secure databases, linked via reference. Additionally, smart contracts must be audited for security vulnerabilities – a flawed contract could be exploited, leading to improper payouts or fund lock-up. Regulators would treat a smart contract failure as the insurer’s operational risk to manage. Encouragingly, Cardano’s focus on formal verification can help in creating more secure contracts. APRA has also issued guidance on **crypto-asset risk management** for regulated entities ([APRA and AUSTRAC provide risk-management guidance in relation ...](https://www.allens.com.au/insights-news/insights/2022/04/apra-and-austrac-provide-risk-management-guidance/#:~:text=APRA%20and%20AUSTRAC%20provide%20risk,to%20activities%20involving%20crypto%20assets)), which would be relevant if insurers start dealing with crypto (for example, if an insurer held cryptocurrency reserves or used crypto payouts). APRA expects rigorous risk assessment, contingency planning, and understanding of the legal uncertainty around crypto transactions ([Crypto-assets: Risk management expectations and policy roadmap](https://www.apra.gov.au/crypto-assets-risk-management-expectations-and-policy-roadmap#:~:text=roadmap%20www,assets%2C%20and%20a%20policy)) ([APRA and AUSTRAC provide risk-management guidance in relation ...](https://www.allens.com.au/insights-news/insights/2022/04/apra-and-austrac-provide-risk-management-guidance/#:~:text=APRA%20and%20AUSTRAC%20provide%20risk,to%20activities%20involving%20crypto%20assets)). For now, if blockchain is used purely as a backend ledger and payouts remain in AUD to customer bank accounts, many of these crypto-specific issues can be mitigated.

- **Legal Enforceability and Contract Law:** Insurance in Australia is governed by the Insurance Contracts Act and other laws that ensure contracts are fair and enforceable. If parts of the insurance agreement are executed via code (smart contracts), insurers must ensure that this does not conflict with legal requirements. For example, a smart contract might auto-decline a claim based on a certain rule – but if that rule isn’t clearly communicated in the PDS (Product Disclosure Statement) or is inconsistent with the duty of utmost good faith, the insurer could be in legal breach. Thus, any automated rules must mirror the actual insurance contract wording that the customer agreed to. One regulatory consideration is how to handle disputes: if a customer disagrees with an automated outcome, there must be a mechanism for human review and override if warranted. The forthcoming enforceability of the Code of Practice by ASIC might demand that even in a tech-driven process, Code standards (like timelines, keeping the customer informed, fair dealings, etc.) are upheld. For parametric products (which pay without need to prove loss), regulators will want to ensure customers understand the basis risk (the payout might not cover full loss if, say, the index doesn’t perfectly reflect their damage) – this falls under ensuring products are offered in a way that’s not misleading or unfair. Clear disclosure and perhaps regulatory approval of novel policy types would be needed.

- **Operational Resilience:** APRA’s prudential standards (like CPS 230 for operational risk management, and CPS 232 for business continuity) will require that any new technology integrated into an insurer’s processes does not introduce single points of failure or unacceptable downtime risk. If an insurer relies on a blockchain platform (perhaps run by a third party or consortium), they need to assess: what if that network goes down or transactions get delayed? Do we have backups or alternative procedures? Similarly, heavy reliance on AI means insurers must plan for scenarios where the AI system is unavailable or malfunctioning – staff must be able to step in. The regulator might ask to see contingency plans for reverting to manual processes if needed during a crisis. 

- **Licensing and Sandbox:** ASIC encourages innovation through its **Innovation Hub** and regulatory sandbox exemptions, which allow testing of new fintech/insurtech services with limited customers without a full license. An insurer or startup looking to trial a blockchain-based insurance product or an AI claims triage system might use these avenues to pilot the service in a controlled way. However, once deployed at scale, all normal licensing conditions apply (e.g., anyone providing insurance in Australia must have an Australian Financial Services License or be an Authorized Representative). Compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) laws also enters if any crypto element is involved in payments.

In essence, Australian regulators are *open to innovation but uncompromising on consumer protection*. The use of apps, AI, and blockchain is permissible and indeed already happening, but insurers must **embed governance and compliance from the start**. As ASIC’s chair Joe Longo put it, firms shouldn’t wait for specific AI laws – they must apply existing obligations to AI now and ensure *“adequate governance arrangements are in place before AI is deployed”* ([

Those who innovate irresponsibly (e.g., deploy an AI that consistently underpays claims to vulnerable customers) can expect enforcement action. Conversely, innovation that clearly benefits customers (faster payouts, more transparency) while managing risks is likely to find support among policymakers, especially in the post-disaster context where improvement is urgently needed.

## Recommendations and Service Model Structuring  
To fully realize the benefits of these improvements, insurers should consider structuring them within a **service-oriented model** – one that can be scalable, modular, and even offered as a shared service or platform. Below are recommendations on implementing the discussed innovations and how they can be structured for maximum impact:

**1. Establish an Industry-Wide “Claims Service Hub”:** Given the systemic nature of disaster claims surges, Australian insurers (possibly under ICA’s coordination) could collaborate on a *Claims Service Hub*. This would be a technology platform – potentially operated by a consortium or a specialized insurtech vendor – that any insurer can plug into during catastrophe events. The hub would integrate: a **unified claims app/portal** for consumers, which intelligently routes claims to the right insurer; shared **AI tools** (trained on industry-wide data) to assist in triage and fraud detection; and a **permissioned blockchain network** (could be built on Cardano or a similar blockchain) where all participating insurers record claims and updates in real-time. Such a hub, functioning as a “claims-processing-as-a-service”, could dramatically improve consistency and speed. For example, after a major flood, all affected consumers could use a single easy app to report damage (no confusion over who to call), and behind the scenes the system identifies their insurer and policy, initiates the claim, and even triggers parametric emergency payouts if applicable. Insurers would still compete on policy offerings and individual service, but the **infrastructure** for handling large volumes of disaster claims would be shared – much like banks share payment network infrastructure. This model could be funded by a subscription or usage fee from insurers, who in turn benefit from lower per-claim handling cost and better customer retention due to smoother service. Regulators might look favorably on an approach that clearly addresses systemic issues (like long delays) in a cooperative way.

**2. Offer “Claims Concierge” as a Service to Customers:** Insurers should consider packaging these innovations into a premium service offering for consumers (or ideally, make it a standard). For instance, a *Claims Concierge Service* could be introduced – where a policyholder, in the event of a loss, gets access to a human case manager aided by all the tech tools (mobile app, AI assistant, etc.). The case manager would be the single point of contact, but they’re supported by AI that provides them with immediate information and even suggests next best actions. This could be marketed as a value-added service (some insurers might include it for customers who opt for higher cover levels or pay a small extra fee). The key is that from the customer’s perspective, the process feels like a well-organized service tailored to them – but behind the scenes it’s the intelligent use of data and AI making it possible to give that personalized touch efficiently. Essentially, it’s turning the traditional claims department into a *customer service team* equipped with next-gen tools. This aligns incentives to treat claimants like valued clients to be helped, not just losses to be managed. 

**3. Leverage SaaS Solutions and Insurtech Partnerships:** Not every insurer will have the resources to develop AI systems or blockchain solutions in-house. Here, the market can develop by specialist vendors offering these as **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** or **Business Process as a Service**. For example, an AI vendor could offer a cloud-based claims automation platform that any insurer can integrate with their systems via APIs – handling everything from claim intake chatbot to document processing and initial adjudication recommendations. Insurers could subscribe to such a service rather than build their own from scratch. Similarly, a blockchain service provider (perhaps in partnership with ICA or a governmental body like the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation) might run a blockchain network for recording catastrophe insurance claims; insurers join as nodes and use the network when needed, without each creating their own blockchain. By subscribing to these services, insurers effectively **outsource part of the technology** but configure it to their policies. The benefit of a service model is scalability and continuous improvement – the provider can update the AI models or platform features for all clients, keeping everyone at the cutting edge. It also lowers the barrier to entry for smaller insurers to access top-tier technology, promoting industry-wide uplift in claims handling standards.

**4. Modular Integration with Legacy Systems:** A pragmatic recommendation is to implement these improvements in a modular way that wraps around existing claim systems. Many insurers have heavy legacy claims systems that are hard to replace outright. A service-model improvement could be a **middleware layer** that sits on top of legacy systems: for instance, a claims API layer that the mobile app and AI tools connect to, which in turn feeds/receives data from the old backend. This way, customers and claim staff get a modern experience through the service layer, even if the core system of record is older. Over time, as insurers modernize core systems (e.g., moving to modern claims management platforms like Guidewire Cloud), these service layers can still plug in or can be phased out as their functionality is absorbed. The key is designing the improvements as *loosely coupled services* rather than monolithic changes.

**5. Regulatory Sandboxing and Gradual Rollout:** For novel elements like smart contract payouts, insurers should work closely with regulators via pilot programs. A recommendation is to run a *limited trial of parametric flood insurance on a blockchain* in one region (say, offering a small payout to policyholders in a high-risk town if certain rainfall levels are exceeded). This could be done in a sandbox with ASIC’s oversight. The results (in terms of payout speed, customer understanding, and any issues) can then inform broader rollout. By structuring this as a controlled service first, trust can be built with regulators and consumers. Another idea is collaborating with government disaster relief programs – for example, a blockchain system could tie into government payments such that once an insurer’s smart contract pays a claim, it could trigger or coordinate with any government relief payments, ensuring a seamless service to the affected person. 

**6. Focus on Training and Change Management:** As these technologies become services utilized by claims teams, invest in training staff to work effectively with them. The human element remains crucial. A well-trained claims handler who understands how to interpret AI suggestions or how to explain a blockchain-triggered payout to a customer will make the service model successful. Insurers could include as part of their service model a dedicated *“technology-enabled claims” training program*, possibly offered industry-wide via ICA, so that the workforce is ready to deliver the improved experience. This is effectively **embedding the service mindset** – that they are providing not just insurance, but a responsive recovery service.

**7. Customer-Centric Metrics and Feedback:** Finally, structure the improvements with clear metrics for success that mirror consumer satisfaction. For example, measure average claim resolution time, percentage of claims resolved within certain timeframes, customer satisfaction scores post-claim, and publish these (per the inquiry’s transparency recommendation). Treat these KPIs as service level agreements (SLAs) of the claims function. If using an external service provider, insurers can even have SLA clauses (e.g., the AI service must process X% of claims within Y hours). By monitoring and disclosing performance, insurers ensure the “claims service” remains accountable and continuously improving. 

In conclusion, the future of insurance claims in Australia can be one where **customers are empowered and supported through technology-driven services**. Imagine a scenario: a consumer experiences a loss, they open their insurer’s app (or a common industry portal) and report it in a few taps with an AI assistant guiding them. Immediately, they receive confirmation and an estimated timeline. Behind the scenes, the system checks data, perhaps triggers an instant partial payout via smart contract for emergency expenses. Over the next days, they get regular updates from an AI-augmented system, and any question they have is answered promptly via chat. Within weeks (or sooner for simpler claims), the claim is settled fairly, with any repair work coordinated efficiently. Throughout, the customer felt in control and informed, not left in the dark. This is a realistic vision if the recommendations above are implemented. By addressing the challenges identified in the 2022 floods inquiry through both policy changes and the smart adoption of apps, GenAI, and blockchain, the insurance ecosystem can substantially improve its service to consumers when they need it most.
