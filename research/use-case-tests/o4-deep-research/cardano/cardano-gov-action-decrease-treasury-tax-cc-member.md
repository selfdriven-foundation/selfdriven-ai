# Prompt & Clarifications:

Great can you do this analysis again, but thinking about it from a Constitutinal Committee Member's perspective - consider that the GA was put on-chain with no pre-socialisation with the community and does not include a risk assessment etc and how that relates to the constitution.

ChatGPT said:

Thank you for the clarification. To refine the analysis from the perspective of a Constitutional Committee Member, I would like to confirm a few key aspects:
Should the focus be primarily on constitutional compliance, particularly regarding procedural adherence (e.g., lack of pre-socialization, missing risk assessment), or should I also reanalyze the economic effects from this governance role's perspective?
Would you like me to highlight precedents or governance best practices that should have been followed?
Should I specifically address whether this governance action, as presented, could be invalidated or contested due to constitutional misalignment?
Let me know if there are any particular constitutional provisions you want emphasized in the review.

# Constitutional Committee Analysis of Treasury Cut Reduction Proposal

## 1. Constitutional Compliance 
**Alignment with Governance Procedures:** The Cardano Constitution lays out clear procedures for introducing on-chain governance actions. **Article III, Section 5** expects proposals to follow a **standardized format with a clear rationale**, including an off-chain reference (URL and hash) and supporting materials explaining the change ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20promote%20transparency,proposal%2C%20and%20relevant%20supporting%20materials)). A Constitutional Committee member would first verify if the proposal to cut the treasury tax from 20% to 10% was documented with sufficient detail (title, abstract, reasons, impact analysis). If the proposer failed to provide a detailed rationale or hash-linked documentation, it would **not meet the transparency and format requirements** set by the constitution ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20promote%20transparency,proposal%2C%20and%20relevant%20supporting%20materials)). This could indicate a lapse in due process, as all on-chain actions must mirror a well-documented off-chain proposal.

**Transparency and Community Consultation:** The constitution emphasizes transparency and inclusive deliberation. *“All owners of ada shall have the right to ensure that the process for participating in, submitting and voting on on-chain governance actions is open and transparent”* ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=All%20owners%20of%20ada%20shall,from%20undue%20influence%20and%20manipulation)). It also expects that proposals be exposed to community debate before they are enacted on-chain ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=Section%206)). If this treasury-cut proposal was submitted **without broad prior disclosure or discussion**, it may violate the spirit of these provisions. A CC member would check whether the change was **socialized with the community (e.g. via forums or an “Info” action)** ahead of time. The constitution (Article III, Section 6) explicitly calls for off-chain processes to **ensure awareness and give the community an opportunity to debate and shape proposals** before on-chain voting ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=Section%206)). Skipping such consultation would raise compliance concerns about insufficient transparency and inclusiveness in the proposal’s genesis.

**Due Process and Guardrails:** The Constitution’s guardrails require certain governance actions to undergo **rigorous review**. A **treasury parameter change** falls under “Protocol Parameter Change,” which *“shall undergo sufficient technical review and scrutiny as mandated by the Guardrails to ensure that the governance action does not endanger the security, functionality, performance or long-term sustainability of the Cardano Blockchain”* ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=,on%20the%20Cardano%20Blockchain%20ecosystem)). From a CC perspective, **lack of a risk assessment or technical analysis** accompanying the proposal is a red flag. The absence of a documented impact or risk analysis means the proposal fails to demonstrate that it won’t harm Cardano’s **long-term sustainability or security**, as **Article III, Section 5** requires ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=,on%20the%20Cardano%20Blockchain%20ecosystem)). In other words, **not providing a risk assessment violates the expected due diligence** for protocol changes, potentially running afoul of governance guardrails. For example, the constitution expects parameter changes to address expected impacts on the ecosystem ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=,on%20the%20Cardano%20Blockchain%20ecosystem)) – if the proposer did not outline how halving the treasury funding might affect network funding or stability, this requirement is unmet.

**Compliance with Numeric Constraints:** The Cardano **Guardrails Appendix** sets explicit boundaries for the treasury tax parameter (treasuryCut). By design, *treasuryCut* **must not be lower than 0.1 (10%) and must not exceed 0.3 (30%)** ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=)). Reducing the treasury take to 10% **hits the minimum allowed limit**, but does not technically breach it. From a constitutional standpoint, the **proposal’s content** is *permissible* in that it stays within the hard-coded guardrail (it would have been outright unconstitutional to go below 10% ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=))). However, setting it at the lowest extreme of the allowed range could be seen as **testing the intent of that guardrail**. The guardrails exist to preserve network health and were likely set by experts to prevent underfunding or overtaxing the ecosystem. A CC member would note that while **no numeric guardrail is violated**, the proposal leaves **no safety margin** – any further reduction would be unconstitutional. This makes the thoroughness of the proposal’s justification even more crucial. Additionally, guardrail **TC-05** advises that *treasuryCut* should not be changed too frequently (no more than once in 36 epochs, ~6 months) ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=TC,0%20%28100)). The CC would verify that this timing guardrail is respected. If this change is the first in over 6 months (which it likely is, since 20% has been the standing value), it meets the letter of TC-05. Nonetheless, the **spirit of the guardrails** is to ensure changes are **carefully considered** – a sudden move to the minimum might conflict with the broader tenet of caution in financial parameters.

**Governance Guardrails and Tenets:** Beyond specific rules, the CC considers the high-level **Tenets** in **Article I** when judging constitutionality ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=These%20below%20Tenets%20shall%20guide,represent%20a%20priority%20among%20Tenets)) ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=,viability%20of%20the%20Cardano%20Blockchain)). **Tenet 9** requires that all users be treated fairly, with decisions made in line with **the long-term sustainability and viability of Cardano** ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=,viability%20of%20the%20Cardano%20Blockchain)). Slashing the treasury allocation without analysis could undermine the **long-term funding** of the ecosystem, potentially conflicting with this tenet on sustainability. **Tenet 10** mandates financial stability for Cardano ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=,45%2C000%2C000%2C000%2C000%2C000%20lovelace)). A CC member would ask whether this proposal imperils Cardano’s financial stability – for instance, by starving the treasury of funds needed for development or by prioritizing short-term rewards over long-term growth. If the proposal did not address how **essential funding needs** will be met with half the usual treasury income, it may be deemed inconsistent with Cardano’s constitutional principles. In summary, while the raw parameter change is **within the allowed bounds**, the **lack of adherence to governance procedure** (transparency, consultation, risk analysis) raises **constitutional compliance issues**. A CC member might conclude that **the proposal as tabled does not fully align with the Constitution’s requirements for process and prudence** ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20promote%20transparency,proposal%2C%20and%20relevant%20supporting%20materials)) ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=,on%20the%20Cardano%20Blockchain%20ecosystem)).

## 2. Governance Best Practices 
**Need for Pre-Socialization:** In healthy on-chain governance, significant changes are normally **pre-socialized with the community** before any vote. Best practices – mirrored by Cardano’s own governance design – suggest using off-chain discussions or **“temperature check”** proposals to build consensus. In Cardano’s model, the **“Info” action** was introduced to let proposers gauge community sentiment without immediately enforcing a change ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=Section%204)). A **Constitutional Committee member** would expect a change as consequential as halving treasury funding to undergo such **community vetting first**, either via forums, workshops, or an Info action. The constitution explicitly states that the community **“is expected to… ensure that there is awareness of and an opportunity to debate and shape all future governance actions”** before they go on-chain ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=Section%206)). If this proposal bypassed that informal consensus-building phase, it **deviated from Cardano’s governance best practices**. Skipping pre-socialization can mean the proposal arrives without the benefit of community insights, expert feedback, or gauging of support – essentially **flying blind** into a vote.

**Risks of Bypassing Engagement Processes:** Bypassing standard engagement (like community discussions, expert reviews, or Catalyst-style feedback) carries several risks. First, **policy blind spots** are more likely – the proposer may not have considered all ramifications or alternative solutions that a broader discussion would surface. For example, reducing the treasury tax might seem beneficial to stakers, but the community at large could point out downsides (such as reduced funding for grants or infrastructure). Indeed, a DRep team has already noted that *“there is no clear evidence”* the change will boost participation and that the ecosystem actually **needs more treasury funds for growth, not less** ([DRep VCC Team’s Perspective on the Proposal to Reduce Treasury Cut - General Governance Conversation - Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/drep-vcc-team-s-perspective-on-the-proposal-to-reduce-treasury-cut/143538#:~:text=Image%3A%20%3Apoint_right%3A%20There%20is%20no,and%20analysis%20rather%20than%20assumptions)). This kind of insight might have been collected **beforehand** if the idea had been widely discussed rather than introduced directly as a formal action. Second, bypassing open debate can spur **community backlash and division**. Stakeholders who feel a proposal was rushed or hidden from scrutiny may mobilize to oppose it on principle, rather than focusing on its merits. This can be seen in the **Viet Cardano Community DRep’s public stance against the proposal**, where they emphasize focusing on long-term value over a “slight” short-term reward bump ([DRep VCC Team’s Perspective on the Proposal to Reduce Treasury Cut - General Governance Conversation - Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/drep-vcc-team-s-perspective-on-the-proposal-to-reduce-treasury-cut/143538#:~:text=Image%3A%20%3Apoint_right%3A%20The%20Cardano%20ecosystem,could%20slow%20down%20these%20efforts)). Their reaction exemplifies how **insufficient scrutiny leads to pushback**, potentially resulting in a no-vote from many DReps. 

Furthermore, ignoring standard processes undermines **trust in governance**. Cardano is entering its Voltaire phase emphasizing decentralization; if participants see that major changes can slip through without robust review, it sets a worrying tone. It may dissuade community members from delegating governance power if they fear it won’t be used accountably. It also sidelines the **collaborative decision-making ethos** that Cardano champions. Best practices would have involved **workshops or forum threads dissecting the treasury rate change**, similar to how CIP-1694 itself was refined through community input and workshops before finalization ([Cardano Governance Updates: Community Input, Voltaire Phase, and CIP-1694 Updates - General Governance Conversation - Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cardano-governance-updates-community-input-voltaire-phase-and-cip-1694-updates/115878#:~:text=On%20March%2013th%2C%202023%2C%20Jared,The%20updates%20and%20changes%20include)). By not following a collaborative process, this proposal misses an opportunity to **legitimize its intent** through community buy-in.

**Precedent for Insufficient Scrutiny:** Endorsing this governance action despite its lack of pre-engagement would set a **troubling precedent**. Other actors might be emboldened to introduce significant protocol changes (economic or technical) **without thorough vetting**, expecting that “if one passed, so can others.” The governance system could then be flooded with ad-hoc proposals that haven’t been stress-tested by peer review or community debate. This scenario is explicitly cautioned against in Cardano’s governance design – it is noted that controlling the flow of governance actions relies on **off-chain social coordination** to avoid clashes and chaos ([Cardano Governance Updates: Community Input, Voltaire Phase, and CIP-1694 Updates - General Governance Conversation - Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cardano-governance-updates-community-input-voltaire-phase-and-cip-1694-updates/115878#:~:text=,1694%20is%20a%20circular%20problem)). If the community and CC allow this proposal to advance without remark, it tacitly implies that **the normal expectation of off-chain socialization can be bypassed**. That would weaken the guardrails of due diligence and could lead to poorly conceived changes slipping through. For instance, someone might next propose an abrupt change to the monetary expansion rate or transaction fees with minimal rationale, citing this treasury-cut case as precedent. 

In summary, **bypassing standard governance processes** in this case is risky. It neglects Cardano’s encouraged best practices of transparency, open debate, and incremental consensus-building. A Constitutional Committee member would likely argue that **any major treasury or protocol adjustment should have been pre-discussed in the community** (through Voltaire town halls, the Cardano Forum, etc.), and possibly introduced first as a non-binding **Info proposal** to collect feedback. Not doing so has led to **avoidable risks and dissent**, and is not a model for sound governance going forward.

## 3. Potential for Invalidation 
**Challenge for Non-Compliance:** Given the concerns above, this proposal could indeed be **challenged or delayed** on grounds of non-compliance with governance standards. Under **Article VII, Section 4** of the Cardano Constitution, **no governance action (except certain confidence votes) can be enacted unless a required percentage of Constitutional Committee members affirm that it **“does not violate this Constitution”**** ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=No%20governance%20action%2C%20other%20than,member%20shall%20have%20one%20vote)). If CC members determine that the treasury-cut proposal violates constitutional requirements – for example, due to **lack of the mandated technical review or insufficient transparency** – they have the power to **withhold their affirmation**, effectively blocking the proposal from moving to implementation. In practical terms, the CC could **vote “No” on constitutional grounds**, citing specific articles (such as Article III, Section 5’s requirements for rationale and review) that the proposal failed to satisfy. This would **invalidate the proposal in its current form**, requiring it to be revised or discarded. Even if the proposal somehow achieved sufficient DRep votes, it cannot be executed on-chain without CC clearance per the on-chain governance rules ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=No%20governance%20action%2C%20other%20than,member%20shall%20have%20one%20vote)). Thus, **Constitutional non-compliance is a show-stopper** – a safeguard intentionally built into Cardano’s governance to prevent unsound actions from being rushed through.

**Mechanisms to Reject or Amend:** The constitution provides clear mechanisms to **reject improperly structured actions**. The **Constitutional Committee’s review** is the primary checkpoint – CC members act as the constitutional gatekeepers and can collectively refuse to ratify a proposal that violates any article or guardrail. If a proposal is deemed unconstitutional, it simply will not be enacted; the proposers would have to amend it and restart the governance process properly. In this case, the CC could formally request that the treasury proposal be **resubmitted as an “Info” action or with an appended risk assessment** to fulfill governance standards. Additionally, Cardano’s governance framework allows for continuous improvement of proposals. There’s an expectation that proposals can be **withdrawn or re-submitted** if issues are found. For example, during the CIP-1694 drafting process, numerous changes were made in response to community feedback (term limits, parameter groupings, etc.), effectively **amending the governance design before it became final** ([Cardano Governance Updates: Community Input, Voltaire Phase, and CIP-1694 Updates - General Governance Conversation - Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cardano-governance-updates-community-input-voltaire-phase-and-cip-1694-updates/115878#:~:text=On%20March%2013th%2C%202023%2C%20Jared,The%20updates%20and%20changes%20include)). By analogy, a governance action like this treasury cut could be *redirected* into a more proper channel (such as an **informational or exploratory proposal**) rather than a rushed parameter change. 

If a proposal somehow slipped through without CC approval (which the rules prevent), other checks and balances exist. **Stake Pool Operators (SPOs)** have a role in certain exceptional governance scenarios – for instance, they have separate voting rights on motions of no confidence and potentially on critical parameter changes ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=match%20at%20L339%20SPOs%20shall,critical%20parameters)). In extreme cases, if the community felt a passed change was harmful or illegitimate, they could initiate a subsequent governance action to **reverse or modify** it (though this is reactive and not ideal). More directly, **dReps and SPOs could collectively vote it down** during the voting phase if they identify the lack of compliance or due diligence. The situation with this proposal already shows signs of such a check: influential DReps have publicly announced opposition, effectively challenging the proposal on grounds of insufficient rationale ([DRep VCC Team’s Perspective on the Proposal to Reduce Treasury Cut - General Governance Conversation - Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/drep-vcc-team-s-perspective-on-the-proposal-to-reduce-treasury-cut/143538#:~:text=Image%3A%20%3Apoint_right%3A%20There%20is%20no,and%20analysis%20rather%20than%20assumptions)). If enough voting power follows that lead, the proposal will simply fail to meet the required voting thresholds, thereby being **rejected by the on-chain vote** – a community-driven invalidation due to perceived poor quality.

**Historical Precedents:** As Cardano’s on-chain governance is new, there are few direct historical examples under the CIP-1694 framework. However, we can draw lessons from analogous governance processes:
- In **Project Catalyst** (Cardano’s precursor funding mechanism), proposals that lacked clarity or violated guidelines were often filtered out or failed to get approval. This demonstrated that the Cardano community expects thoroughness; incomplete proposals do not succeed, effectively “self-policing” the standards. 
- Within Cardano improvement proposals (CIPs), **major changes have historically been preceded by extensive peer review and community debate**. For instance, adjustments to stake pool parameters (like the minimum pool fee) took years of discussion and several CIP iterations before any change was executed. Early drafts that didn’t account for all risks were sent back for more work – a de facto invalidation until they met the bar. This shows a pattern: **when due process isn’t followed, the community delays adoption until proper analysis is done**.
- We also see in other blockchain communities that proposals introduced without sufficient consultation can be overturned. For example, on Polkadot’s governance forum, certain treasury spending proposals faced strong opposition and were abandoned or revamped due to community feedback about lack of transparency. While not Cardano, these cases reinforce that **decentralized governance tends to correct or reject actions seen as ignoring process or risking the ecosystem**.

In the context of Cardano’s constitution, if this treasury-cut proposal is judged non-compliant, the straightforward recourse is **to not ratify it**. The CC could issue an on-chain statement (via their vote commentary) explaining why – much like how CC members may record opinions even on Info actions to signal constitutional issues ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=Members%20of%20the%20Constitutional%20Committee,chain%20mechanisms)). That feedback loop encourages the proposer to **amend the proposal structure** (e.g., add a proper risk assessment, gather community support) and try again in a constitutionally acceptable way. In summary, the **governance system has robust avenues to halt or fix proposals that don’t follow the rules**. The likely outcome if standards aren’t met is that the proposal is either **voted down or sent back to the drawing board** rather than blindly executed.

## 4. Economic Effects from a Governance Perspective 
**Impact on Long-Term Governance Funding:** From a governance perspective, reducing the treasury’s intake from 20% to 10% has significant long-term implications. The Cardano treasury is the source of funding for development, community projects (e.g. Catalyst grants), and also the **budget for governance itself** (such as DRep and Constitutional Committee compensation) ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=from%20the%20Cardano%20Blockchain%20treasury,shall%20provide%20for%20periodic%20administrative)) ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=)). Halving the treasury income **directly affects the sustainability of these funds**. A Constitutional Committee member would be concerned that *less money flowing into the treasury means fewer resources for future initiatives*. Over time, this could **slow down the growth and maintenance of the ecosystem**, contradicting the goal of a self-sustaining blockchain. The DRep Viet_Cardano_Community team highlighted that Cardano needs **more resources, not less, to fund development, marketing, and DApp liquidity** ([DRep VCC Team’s Perspective on the Proposal to Reduce Treasury Cut - General Governance Conversation - Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/drep-vcc-team-s-perspective-on-the-proposal-to-reduce-treasury-cut/143538#:~:text=Image%3A%20%3Apoint_right%3A%20The%20Cardano%20ecosystem,could%20slow%20down%20these%20efforts)). This underscores a governance risk: if the treasury becomes underfunded, crucial programs might stall or shrink (for example, fewer grants for infrastructure or reduced support for governance tooling). In effect, approving this cut might force the community to either curtail ambitions or seek alternative funding mechanisms down the road – a tough position that could have been avoided by maintaining a healthier treasury inflow. 

**Treasury Sustainability and Tenet Alignment:** Economically, the treasury cut ties into **Tenet 9’s mandate for long-term sustainability** ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=,viability%20of%20the%20Cardano%20Blockchain)). Governance funding is a long-term concern; the **Voltaire era** assumes an ongoing treasury to fund the ecosystem perpetually. A CC member would analyze whether a 10% tax is sufficient for that perpetual funding. If not accompanied by other changes, 10% may dramatically slow treasury growth, potentially **endangering future budgets** (like the annual Cardano ecosystem budget). It’s worth noting that the **monetary expansion (ADA reserve drawdown) is finite** – eventually, less and less ADA will be issued as rewards. Dedicating only half of the previous rate to the treasury could mean **treasury peaks at a lower amount** before reserves taper off. This could leave the community with fewer funds in the future to govern effectively, possibly **undermining financial stability (Tenet 10) in the long run** ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=,45%2C000%2C000%2C000%2C000%2C000%20lovelace)) if not carefully planned. The proposal, however, provided no risk modeling or fiscal projections (no evidence of such was presented), leaving governance participants **uncertain about the long-range effects**. Such uncertainty is problematic: governance decisions should be made with a clear understanding of future scenarios, especially when altering something as foundational as the reward split.

**Uncertainty Without Risk Assessment:** The lack of a formal risk or impact assessment means the community is essentially guessing at the effects. From a governance viewpoint, this introduces **significant uncertainty for stakeholders**. For instance, **Delegated Representatives (DReps)** must explain to their delegators how this change could affect Cardano’s roadmap – without analysis, they cannot confidently do so. This uncertainty alone can justify a conservative stance (i.e., rejecting the change until studied). One immediate economic effect to consider is stakeholder behavior: Will a 10% treasury cut meaningfully increase staking participation or rewards? The **proposer might assume more rewards to stakers will attract participants**, but as the VCC DRep team noted, a *“slight increase in staking rewards does not bring significant benefits to delegators”* ([DRep VCC Team’s Perspective on the Proposal to Reduce Treasury Cut - General Governance Conversation - Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/drep-vcc-team-s-perspective-on-the-proposal-to-reduce-treasury-cut/143538#:~:text=Image%3A%20%3Apoint_right%3A%20A%20slight%20increase,term%20benefits)). In fact, the difference in annual yield may be marginal, whereas the **loss to collective funding is large**. Without data, the net effect could even be negative (if ADA’s value growth slows due to fewer projects, delegators could be worse off despite a minor reward bump). This kind of **nuanced economic risk** should have been evaluated beforehand. 

Moreover, **governance actors like the CC or CF (Cardano Foundation)** would worry about second-order effects: with less treasury funding, if critical infrastructure needs arise (say, emergency protocol upgrades or major dApp ecosystem investments), the community might have to impose new taxes or fees later to compensate. That would be far more contentious. So approving this cut now **could set a precedent that economically risky decisions can be taken on insufficient analysis**, leaving future governance to deal with potential fallout. The CC’s mandate to ensure no action endangers the network’s sustainability ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=,on%20the%20Cardano%20Blockchain%20ecosystem)) directly ties into this concern – an inadequately examined cut endangers financial sustainability in a subtle but impactful way.

**Precedent for Economic Decision-Making:** If the community were to approve this change as-is, it might encourage similar economically driven proposals without proper scrutiny. Treasury allocation is a key economic lever; another example is the **monetary expansion rate**, which if changed could dramatically affect ADA supply and staking incentives. The guardrails for monetary expansion suggest only gradual changes with careful measurement ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=ME,005)), indicating that **economic parameters should be handled cautiously**. By pushing through a maximum-range treasury cut with minimal process, the message sent would be that **major economic adjustments need not go through rigorous debate**. This is a dangerous precedent. It could lead to governance volatility – e.g., a swing in sentiment might lead to raising the treasury cut back up or oscillating it, undermining predictability. Such instability would hurt Cardano’s reputation as a well-governed platform and could deter long-term investors or builders who crave stable policies.

In summary, **from a governance standpoint the economic implications counsel caution**. The proposal stands to **weaken long-term treasury funds**, possibly starving the engine of Cardano’s development and innovation pipeline. The **lack of a risk assessment means stakeholders are asked to make this decision without clear forecasts**, essentially a gamble with Cardano’s future funding. Approving the change under these conditions would not only risk the specific outcome (a poorer treasury) but also establish a norm that sweeping economic changes can be made **without due diligence** – a norm the Constitutional Committee would strongly advise against.

## 5. Recommendations 
**Revise or Delay the Proposal:** As a Constitutional Committee member, the prudent recommendation would be to **not proceed with this proposal in its current form**. Ideally, the proposal should be **revised or temporarily withdrawn** to address the procedural and analytical gaps identified. The CC could formally advise converting this into an **“Info” action (non-binding proposal) for further study and community input**, rather than an immediate protocol change. This would align the process with constitutional principles by allowing debate and refinement ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=Section%206)). By doing so, the proposer can collaborate with the community to conduct a proper impact analysis – for example, modeling how a 10% treasury cut affects the ecosystem over 1, 5, and 10 years, and perhaps exploring incremental approaches (like a trial reduction to 15% first). **Delaying the decision** until such data and community feedback are gathered is in the best interest of Cardano’s governance. It ensures that if and when the proposal comes up for an actual vote again, it will meet the standards of transparency and due diligence required by the constitution.

**Safeguards if Proceeding:** If, however, there is a strong desire or pressure to move forward now, then certain **safeguards or amendments** should be attached to the proposal to bring it closer to constitutional compliance. First, it should be **amended to include a comprehensive rationale and risk assessment**, as required by Article III, Section 5 ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20promote%20transparency,proposal%2C%20and%20relevant%20supporting%20materials)) ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=,on%20the%20Cardano%20Blockchain%20ecosystem)). This means appending a detailed document (with an immutable hash reference on-chain) outlining the purpose of the change, data supporting it (e.g. projected staking increase vs. loss of treasury funds), and an analysis of risks (impact on funding, contingency plans if outcomes differ). The CC could insist that this documentation be produced and shared publicly before they give their constitutional sign-off. Second, an **explicit reference to Constitutional Tenets** should be made: the proposal ought to explain how it remains consistent with **Tenet 9 (long-term sustainability)** and **Tenet 10 (financial stability)** ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=,viability%20of%20the%20Cardano%20Blockchain)) ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=,45%2C000%2C000%2C000%2C000%2C000%20lovelace)) despite the reduction. For instance, it might propose that *if* the treasury balance begins to decline too rapidly relative to needs, the community will consider other measures (like adjusting monetary expansion or revisiting the tax). Including such considerations shows that the proposer has thought through alignment with constitutional principles. Third, a possible **safeguard is a built-in review mechanism**: the proposal could be coupled with a mandate that the effect of the treasury cut will be reviewed after a certain period (say, 6 months or 1 year) via an **automatic “sunset” or re-evaluation clause**. While on-chain enforcement of this is tricky, the community could at least agree that a follow-up governance action (perhaps another Info action or even a reversal proposal) will be triggered to assess whether the 10% cut should remain or be adjusted. This creates accountability for the decision and mitigates long-term risk by not treating the change as irreversible.

**Recommendation to Reject (if Unamended):** Should the proposal remain as-is – lacking the above revisions – the recommendation from a CC member would be to **reject it outright** at this time. This rejection is not necessarily against the idea of adjusting the treasury rate per se, but against the **manner in which it was brought forward**. A CC member’s duty is to uphold the constitution, which means ensuring proper process. Without corrections, the proposal would still violate process expectations (transparency, due diligence) and thus merit a **“No” vote on constitutional grounds**. The CC’s rejection would signal that the proposal is **unconstitutional in form**, forcing a re-submission through the correct procedures. In doing so, the CC both protects Cardano in the short term (from an inadequately vetted change) and reinforces governance norms.

**Future Process Improvements:** This situation highlights areas where Cardano’s governance process can improve to prevent similar issues. One recommendation is to **formalize the requirement for pre-socialization of major proposals**. For example, governance rules could mandate that any protocol parameter change above a certain impact threshold must first be introduced as an **Info action or discussed in a recognized public forum** for at least one governance cycle before an official vote. This gives a structured “cooling off” and feedback period. Another adaptation could be establishing a **governance review board or task force** (possibly a role the CC can play informally) that reviews draft proposals for completeness **before** they are submitted on-chain. Such a body could check: Is there a risk assessment? Are constitutional references addressed? Have key stakeholders been consulted? If not, they can advise the proposer to do so, preventing incomplete proposals from ever reaching a vote. Additionally, **tooling and education** can help – providing templates and checklists to proposers (e.g., ensure you have filled out sections on motivation, impact, risks, community feedback summary, etc., in line with Article III Section 5 ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20promote%20transparency,proposal%2C%20and%20relevant%20supporting%20materials))) will embed best practices into the culture.

Finally, the community could look at using the **Cardano improvement proposal (CIP) process** in tandem with on-chain governance: significant changes to parameters could be expected to go through a CIP review (which includes community feedback and expert review) and only then be turned into an on-chain action. This two-step approach (off-chain CIP then on-chain vote) would ensure that by the time a change gets to the Constitutional Committee, it has already been vetted for constitutional and technical soundness. In essence, **governance processes should adapt by creating better upfront filters and engagement requirements** for impactful decisions. This will prevent future scenarios where the CC is put in the position of having to veto an action due to avoidable process omissions.

**Conclusion:** In conclusion, as a Constitutional Committee member I would advise that this treasury cut proposal be **either sent back for refinement or voted down**, due to its misalignment with constitutional process and potential risks to Cardano’s funding model. Only with proper transparency, community input, and risk evaluation – which are all core tenets of Cardano’s governance philosophy – should such a measure be reconsidered for adoption. By enforcing these standards now, the CC and community safeguard the integrity of the Voltaire governance system and set the expectation that **all future proposals must meet the high bar set by our Constitution and governance best practices**.
