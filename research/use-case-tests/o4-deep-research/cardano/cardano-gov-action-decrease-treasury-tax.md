# Reducing Cardano Treasury Cut from 20% to 10%: Proposal Analysis

## Effect of the Change

- **Staking Rewards**: Lowering the treasury cut means a larger share of each epoch’s rewards goes to stakers. Currently, 20% of the ADA from fees and monetary expansion is taken for the treasury, with 80% distributed as staking rewards ([We Must Spend Responsibly From The Cardano Treasury | Cardano Explorer](https://cexplorer.io/article/we-must-spend-responsibly-from-the-cardano-treasury#:~:text=Every%205%20days%2C%20during%20the,reward%20pool%20operators%20and%20stakers)). Cutting the treasury portion to 10% would increase the rewards pool for stake pools and delegators from 80% to 90% of each epoch’s distribution. In practical terms, this ~12.5% relative increase in staking rewards could modestly raise annual ROI for delegators (e.g. from ~3% to ~3.3-3.5%, depending on other factors). More generous rewards might encourage additional ADA holders to participate in staking, as the incentive to delegate or run a node becomes slightly more attractive.

- **Treasury Funding**: The trade-off is a reduction in treasury income. Halving the treasury’s cut means the treasury will accumulate new funds at only half the current rate. For example, about *4.7 million ADA* currently enters the treasury each epoch at a 20% cut ([We Must Spend Responsibly From The Cardano Treasury | Cardano Explorer](https://cexplorer.io/article/we-must-spend-responsibly-from-the-cardano-treasury#:~:text=Each%20epoch%2C%20Cardano%20cashes%20in,are%20deposited%20into%20the%20treasury)). At a 10% cut, the treasury would receive roughly *2.3 million ADA* per epoch under similar conditions, with the rest flowing to stakers. Over a year, this could reduce treasury inflows from an estimated ~300 million ADA to ~150 million ADA (assuming reserves and fees at 2025 levels) ([We Must Spend Responsibly From The Cardano Treasury | Cardano Explorer](https://cexplorer.io/article/we-must-spend-responsibly-from-the-cardano-treasury#:~:text=However%2C%20by%20the%20end%20of,decrease%20to%204%2C4%20million%20ADA)). Such a slowdown in treasury growth could impact the funds available for future on-chain development, community projects, and other ecosystem expenses.

- **Network Participation**: In theory, increasing staking rewards may boost participation in staking. A higher reward rate can incentivize more ADA holders to delegate or run stake pools, potentially converting some passive holders into active network participants. Greater participation would improve Cardano’s already high staking rate (currently a large majority of ADA is staked) and could enhance network security (since attack resistance in proof-of-stake grows as more stake is actively securing the network). However, it’s uncertain *how much* additional participation a modest reward increase would generate. Critics note there is **no clear evidence** yet that reducing the treasury tax will significantly increase the number of staking participants – this claim remains speculative without concrete data ([DRep VCC Team’s Perspective on the Proposal to Reduce Treasury Cut - General Governance Conversation - Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/drep-vcc-team-s-perspective-on-the-proposal-to-reduce-treasury-cut/143538#:~:text=Image%3A%20%3Apoint_right%3A%20There%20is%20no,and%20analysis%20rather%20than%20assumptions)). Given that Cardano’s staking participation is already robust, the marginal gain in new stakers might be limited.

- **Economic Sustainability**: This change shifts the balance between immediate rewards and long-term ecosystem funding. On one hand, more ADA in the hands of stakers could strengthen the network’s economic decentralization (more distributed rewards) and potentially increase ADA’s attractiveness (which might positively influence market demand and price). On the other hand, less funding going into the treasury raises questions about sustaining development and growth. Cardano’s monetary expansion (about 0.3% of the reserve per epoch) remains unchanged ([We Must Spend Responsibly From The Cardano Treasury | Cardano Explorer](https://cexplorer.io/article/we-must-spend-responsibly-from-the-cardano-treasury#:~:text=Every%205%20days%2C%20during%20the,reward%20pool%20operators%20and%20stakers)), so total ADA issuance isn’t increased – it’s the allocation that changes. Thus, the *total supply trajectory* (capped at 45 billion ADA) is unaffected, but the **distribution** changes, favoring short-term network participants over the collective pool for future investments. This could be seen as prioritizing present network security and rewards at the potential expense of future-building capacity, which is a key sustainability trade-off.

## Arguments in Favor

Proponents of reducing the treasury cut to 10% highlight several potential benefits:

- **Increased Staking Incentives**: By boosting the share of rewards to stakers, Cardano becomes more rewarding to participate in. This proposal explicitly aims to *“increase staking rewards for both SPOs and delegators”* ([Intersect Development Update #50 February 21st](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/intersect-development-update-50-february-21st#:~:text=to%20reduce%20the%20Cardano%20treasury,provide%20guidance%20on%20the%20impacts)). Higher rewards can improve the appeal of running a stake pool or delegating ADA, which not only benefits individual stakeholders but also helps secure the network. Small stake pool operators, in particular, may find it slightly easier to attract delegators when more reward is on the table, and their own margins (a percentage of rewards) would yield higher absolute returns. In sum, a 10% treasury tax could enhance Cardano’s competitive yield profile, possibly drawing in more participants and discouraging ADA holders from leaving their stake idle or moving to other platforms.

- **Improved Decentralization**: Supporters argue that keeping more ADA with the community (as rewards) rather than in a centralized treasury fund bolsters decentralization. Treasury funds are controlled by governance mechanisms, which, while decentralized in design, concentrate a large amount of value in a single pool. Reducing the growth of this pool means more value remains distributed among ADA holders. This could reduce the risk of the treasury becoming a massive honeypot that, if mismanaged or captured by a small group, could unduly influence the ecosystem. Furthermore, if staking incentives succeed in drawing broader participation, the *effective decentralization* of the network increases – more stakeholders participating in consensus and governance. Every additional ADA holder who chooses to stake or run a pool because of improved rewards is one more independent participant reinforcing Cardano’s decentralized character. In essence, this adjustment is seen as a way to **“align economic incentives”** with decentralization goals, ensuring that those who secure the network are directly rewarded, and power (in the form of ADA) isn’t overly amassed in the treasury.

- **Stronger Network Security**: Cardano’s security in proof-of-stake partly relies on a high percentage of ADA being staked by honest participants. By making staking more attractive, the network could inch closer to full participation, which strengthens security assumptions. If more ADA is actively staked (and fewer coins sit on exchanges or in inactive wallets), it becomes harder for a malicious actor to acquire a majority of stake to attack the network. In Ouroboros, any ADA not staked results in unclaimed rewards that epoch (those would be returned to the reserve) ([Cardano’s stake pool pledge and margin mechanics | Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/developer-platform/discover/solutions/cardano-stake-pledge-margin#:~:text=2,is%20subtracted)). Therefore, encouraging near-total staking not only improves reward distribution but also means the system is maximally utilizing its inflation for honest participants. Advocates believe that shifting the treasury cut downwards will *“strengthen...network security”* by increasing the stake participation rate (as was noted in community discussions) ([Intersect Development Update #50 February 21st](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/intersect-development-update-50-february-21st#:~:text=This%20action%20aims%20to%20reduce,This)). In summary, more stakeholders earning rewards translates to a broader base securing the ledger, which is beneficial for the network’s resilience.

- **Efficient Use of Treasury**: Another supportive argument is that the treasury is already quite large and growing, possibly faster than it’s being deployed. As of late 2023, the Cardano treasury held **over 1.5 billion ADA** ([We Must Spend Responsibly From The Cardano Treasury | Cardano Explorer](https://cexplorer.io/article/we-must-spend-responsibly-from-the-cardano-treasury#:~:text=The%20Cardano%20treasury%20holds%201,84%20billion%20ADA)), while historically it has been funding Catalyst project rounds at about 50 million ADA per round (roughly 200 million ADA per year if four rounds) ([We Must Spend Responsibly From The Cardano Treasury | Cardano Explorer](https://cexplorer.io/article/we-must-spend-responsibly-from-the-cardano-treasury#:~:text=The%20sole%20expenditure%20from%20the,from%20the%20treasury%20in%202025)). At the current 20% cut, treasury reserves have been increasing each epoch. Some proponents suggest that such a high allocation might not be necessary at this stage – essentially, that the treasury can afford to grow more slowly. If the treasury has more than enough funds for near-term needs, reducing the intake could be seen as **right-sizing** the funding rate to avoid idle accumulation of ADA. In the meantime, the ADA not sent to treasury would be put to work incentivizing network participants. This view assumes that the existing war chest (plus a 10% ongoing cut) is sufficient to fund development and that **excessive treasury growth could even be counterproductive** (e.g., by introducing inflationary ADA that isn’t immediately used). By trimming the treasury tax, Cardano can reward its community now without critically starving future initiatives – effectively striking a new balance if the original 20% is deemed overly conservative.

## Arguments Against

Critics of the proposal raise several concerns and potential downsides:

- **Treasury Sustainability and Ecosystem Funding**: The most prominent concern is that cutting the treasury’s income in half could undermine Cardano’s long-term funding for growth. The treasury exists to finance development, integrations, community projects, and even critical infrastructure or marketing efforts. Opponents argue that *now* is not the time to throttle back on these funds. In fact, they point out that **the Cardano ecosystem likely needs more resources from the treasury, not less, to accelerate development and adoption** ([DRep VCC Team’s Perspective on the Proposal to Reduce Treasury Cut - General Governance Conversation - Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/drep-vcc-team-s-perspective-on-the-proposal-to-reduce-treasury-cut/143538#:~:text=Image%3A%20%3Apoint_right%3A%20The%20Cardano%20ecosystem,could%20slow%20down%20these%20efforts)). Major endeavors – from improving core technology, to growing dApp ecosystems, to user acquisition – often require significant investment. Reducing the treasury inflow could *slow down or limit* these efforts, leaving Cardano with fewer means to compete and innovate. Essentially, this view prioritizes fueling the ecosystem’s expansion (through well-funded proposals and initiatives) over marginally boosting individual staking returns.

- **Minimal Benefit to Delegators**: From a delegator’s perspective, the increase in rewards, while nice, may not be very impactful. A change from 20% to 10% treasury tax would only increase a delegator’s APY by a small fraction (on the order of 0.3–0.5 percentage points, given current rates). Critics note that such a **slight uptick in staking rewards does not bring significant benefits to individual ADA holders** ([DRep VCC Team’s Perspective on the Proposal to Reduce Treasury Cut - General Governance Conversation - Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/drep-vcc-team-s-perspective-on-the-proposal-to-reduce-treasury-cut/143538#:~:text=Image%3A%20%3Apoint_right%3A%20A%20slight%20increase,term%20benefits)) – certainly not enough to fundamentally change investment decisions or compensate for a lack of ecosystem growth. In contrast, the *indirect* benefits of a well-funded treasury (such as a thriving network, new dApps, higher ADA demand and price) could far outweigh the direct extra rewards. As one DRep team put it, *“strong investment in ecosystem development creates real value, helping ADA appreciate sustainably. The focus should be on long-term growth rather than short-term benefits.”* ([DRep VCC Team’s Perspective on the Proposal to Reduce Treasury Cut - General Governance Conversation - Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/drep-vcc-team-s-perspective-on-the-proposal-to-reduce-treasury-cut/143538#:~:text=Image%3A%20%3Apoint_right%3A%20A%20slight%20increase,term%20benefits)) In other words, a bigger pie (via ADA price and utility increases) beats slightly larger individual slices of a smaller pie. By diverting funds away from development, the proposal might sacrifice future value for a modest present gain.

- **No Clear Evidence of Staking Boost**: While the proposal’s premise is that higher rewards will spur greater participation, skeptics are not convinced this will meaningfully happen. They argue that most active ADA holders who want to stake are *already* doing so under the current regime. Indeed, Cardano’s staking participation is among the highest in the industry. A DRep group expressed that *“there is no clear evidence that reducing the contribution to the Treasury will increase the number of staking participants”*, calling for data rather than assumptions ([DRep VCC Team’s Perspective on the Proposal to Reduce Treasury Cut - General Governance Conversation - Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/drep-vcc-team-s-perspective-on-the-proposal-to-reduce-treasury-cut/143538#:~:text=Image%3A%20%3Apoint_right%3A%20There%20is%20no,and%20analysis%20rather%20than%20assumptions)). If behavior doesn’t change much, then the network would effectively be giving up a chunk of its treasury funding for little in return. Worse, even if a few more percent of ADA gets staked, the **marginal security gain might be negligible**, since Cardano is already secure with the current participation. Thus, the core justification (improved security and decentralization via more staking) could be a weak rationale to justify the definite cost of lost funding.

- **Governance and Budget Limitations**: Another angle of concern is how this reduction could constrain the newly emerging on-chain governance processes. Treasury funds will soon be the lifeblood of Cardano’s governance – paying for things like Project Catalyst grants, community initiatives, and possibly compensating DReps or Constitutional Committee members in the future. A smaller treasury growth rate means the community will have to either scale back its ambitions or find external funding for some programs. This could limit the scope of what can be achieved through governance. There’s also a worry about **long-term trade-offs**: if the treasury doesn’t accumulate enough in the early years, Cardano might struggle to fund big-ticket items down the road (for example, large-scale dApp incentives, academic research, or emergency funds in case of protocol issues). While the cut can be raised later if needed, constantly changing such a fundamental parameter could be disruptive or politically difficult. In short, opponents see the 20% treasury allocation as a prudent measure for *future-proofing* Cardano, ensuring that the platform has the financial backbone to support its growth and adapt to unforeseen challenges. Reducing it now, in their view, is an unnecessary risk to that safety net.

- **Economic and Market Risks**: Some detractors also note possible unintended economic effects. For instance, diverting an extra share of ADA to stakeholders could increase *sell pressure* if those reward recipients decide to cash out their slightly higher rewards regularly. In contrast, ADA left in the treasury is essentially locked until allocated to projects (and even then often released gradually for project funding). Thus, keeping more ADA in the treasury might actually dampen circulating supply growth and market sell pressure in the short term, whereas pushing more rewards out could put more ADA into circulation sooner. If market demand doesn’t rise commensurately, this could exert downward pressure on ADA’s price. Additionally, if ADA’s price were to *fall* or remain low, a 10% treasury cut would yield very limited funding in dollar terms, potentially starving critical development just when it’s needed most. The reliance on ADA price and transaction fee growth becomes more acute with a smaller cut – if those factors don’t improve, the treasury could be left underfunded to meet the ecosystem’s needs. These scenarios outline how the seemingly simple change has complex macroeconomic ripple effects that need careful consideration.

## Compliance with Guardrails (Constitutionality)

Any change to Cardano’s protocol parameters must adhere to the Cardano Constitution’s guardrails. In the constitutional framework (Appendix I), **Treasury Cut (treasuryCut)** is indeed bounded by explicit limits. According to the Guardrails in *Section 2.1*, the treasury cut **“must not be lower than 0.1 (10%)” and “must not exceed 0.3 (30%)”** ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=)). This means the treasury tax rate can be set anywhere from 10% up to 30% by governance action, but not outside that range. The current setting is 0.20 (20%), which lies in the middle. The proposal to reduce it to 0.10 (10%) is exactly at the minimum permissible limit defined by **TC-01** and **TC-02** guardrails ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=TC,1%20%2810)). 

Crucially, this implies the change is **constitutionally allowed** – it does not violate any hard constraints. A treasury cut of 10% is the lowest end of the allowed spectrum, but still compliant with the constitutional parameters put in place to ensure financial stability. As such, if passed, this parameter update would not require any constitutional amendment or special override; it fits within the pre-approved safe bounds for treasury allocation.

However, being at the floor of the allowed range means there is **no further room to lower the treasury cut** in the future without first amending the Constitution’s guardrails. The framers likely set 10% as a safety floor to guarantee that at least some portion of ongoing inflation always feeds the treasury (preventing a scenario where 0% goes to treasury and the ecosystem starves itself of funds). By going to that floor, the community would be pushing this economic lever to its limit. It’s also worth noting that another guardrail, **TC-05**, stipulates that the treasuryCut parameter *“must not be changed more than once in any 36 epoch period (≈6 months)”* ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=TC,1%20%2810)). This means that if the cut is reduced now, it cannot be changed again (up or down) for at least six months. So, the decision should be made with the understanding that it can’t be easily tweaked again in the very short term. In summary, the proposal is **within the constitutional treasury cut limits** ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=)) (passing TC-01/02 checks), but it does represent an extreme adjustment that will hit the constitutional floor for this parameter.

## Effect on Treasury and Supply

Reducing the treasury cut has direct implications for the treasury’s size over time and the ADA supply distribution:

- **Treasury Funding and Outlays**: With only a 10% allocation, the treasury will grow at a slower pace and could even shrink if expenditures outweigh income. Under status quo (20%), treasury inflows from the reserve are projected around *300 million ADA in 2025* ([We Must Spend Responsibly From The Cardano Treasury | Cardano Explorer](https://cexplorer.io/article/we-must-spend-responsibly-from-the-cardano-treasury#:~:text=However%2C%20by%20the%20end%20of,decrease%20to%204%2C4%20million%20ADA)). Many in the community expect significant outflows in the coming years to fund projects (Catalyst or other Voltaire-era initiatives). For instance, if Catalyst continues with roughly 4 funds per year at ~50 million ADA each, that’s ~200 million ADA outflow per year ([We Must Spend Responsibly From The Cardano Treasury | Cardano Explorer](https://cexplorer.io/article/we-must-spend-responsibly-from-the-cardano-treasury#:~:text=The%20sole%20expenditure%20from%20the,from%20the%20treasury%20in%202025)). At a 20% cut, the treasury would still see a net positive inflow (300M in minus 200M out = +100M ADA/year, roughly) ([We Must Spend Responsibly From The Cardano Treasury | Cardano Explorer](https://cexplorer.io/article/we-must-spend-responsibly-from-the-cardano-treasury#:~:text=In%202025%2C%20revenues%20to%20the,million%20to%2010%20million%20ADA)) ([We Must Spend Responsibly From The Cardano Treasury | Cardano Explorer](https://cexplorer.io/article/we-must-spend-responsibly-from-the-cardano-treasury#:~:text=The%20Cardano%20community%27s%20priority%20is,until%20Ouroboros%20Leios%20is%20implemented)). At a 10% cut, however, the inflow might be on the order of 150M ADA/year (all else equal). This would **not cover** a 200M ADA yearly budget, leading to a net *deficit* of -50M ADA/year in the treasury. In other words, the treasury could start depleting its reserves if spending remains at planned levels, which is a concern for long-term sustainability. It’s telling that community analysts have emphasized *“avoid having expenses exceed income”* in treasury management ([We Must Spend Responsibly From The Cardano Treasury | Cardano Explorer](https://cexplorer.io/article/we-must-spend-responsibly-from-the-cardano-treasury#:~:text=The%20Cardano%20community%27s%20priority%20is,until%20Ouroboros%20Leios%20is%20implemented)). Reducing income makes that balance harder to achieve. Unless project funding is curtailed or made more efficient, a 10% cut could mean drawing down on the 1.5B ADA treasury stash sooner than anticipated.

- **ADA Supply Dynamics**: On the supply side, this change doesn’t alter the maximum supply (45 billion ADA) or the monetary expansion rate directly – it reallocates distribution of newly minted ADA. Total new ADA introduced each epoch is determined by the monetary expansion parameter (ρ, about 0.3% of remaining reserve) and transaction fees ([We Must Spend Responsibly From The Cardano Treasury | Cardano Explorer](https://cexplorer.io/article/we-must-spend-responsibly-from-the-cardano-treasury#:~:text=Every%205%20days%2C%20during%20the,reward%20pool%20operators%20and%20stakers)). That amount will be created regardless; the question is where it goes. At 20% treasury cut, 80% of new ADA goes to stakeholders and 20% to the treasury (which is an account that holds ADA on-chain). At 10%, 90% goes to stakeholders and 10% to treasury. In both cases, the *same total* ADA is leaving the reserve and entering circulation (treasury funds are effectively in circulation supply, albeit earmarked for governance). Thus, the **rate of ADA inflation remains the same** in aggregate. One subtle effect is that if more ADA holders stake due to higher rewards, a smaller fraction of the potential rewards get returned to the reserve unclaimed. Currently, since not 100% of ADA is staked, any rewards that would have gone to unstaked ADA are not minted and instead stay in the reserve ([Cardano’s stake pool pledge and margin mechanics | Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/developer-platform/discover/solutions/cardano-stake-pledge-margin#:~:text=2,is%20subtracted)). If staking participation increases, more of those rewards will be claimed (increasing actual distributed supply) and less is kept in reserve. This could very slightly accelerate the effective token distribution from the reserve (though Cardano’s design already anticipates eventual full reserve depletion by design). In summary, moving to a 10% treasury cut largely **redistributes new issuance** from the treasury to individual stakers, without changing the pre-set monetary expansion schedule.

- **ADA Price and Market Conditions**: The impact on treasury funding must be viewed in light of ADA’s price and adoption. If ADA’s price were to **appreciate significantly**, a smaller ADA inflow might still be sufficient in dollar terms to fund development. For example, half the ADA might be needed if each ADA is worth twice as much. Proponents might bank on improved sentiment and network effects (from higher staking rewards) to buoy ADA’s value, offsetting the reduced quantity of ADA in the treasury. Conversely, in a bear market or if ADA price stagnates, cutting the treasury’s ADA income could be painful – the treasury would have fewer coins *and* each coin is worth less, severely limiting funding capacity. Additionally, as mentioned, circulating supply dynamics could affect price. With more rewards going directly to users, there’s a possibility of increased sell pressure if those users liquidate rewards, whereas funds staying in the treasury might effectively stay off-market until used for a project. Market conditions will influence whether this trade-off ends up net positive (via improved sentiment and holding due to better rewards) or net negative (via insufficient funding and sell pressure). Another consideration is transaction fee revenue: as Cardano’s usage grows, fees contribute more to rewards and treasury. Today, fees are a minor component (tens of thousands of ADA per epoch vs millions from reserves) ([We Must Spend Responsibly From The Cardano Treasury | Cardano Explorer](https://cexplorer.io/article/we-must-spend-responsibly-from-the-cardano-treasury#:~:text=Each%20epoch%2C%20Cardano%20cashes%20in,are%20deposited%20into%20the%20treasury)). The community hopes to *“boost the amount of collected fees... tenfold over the next five years”* ([We Must Spend Responsibly From The Cardano Treasury | Cardano Explorer](https://cexplorer.io/article/we-must-spend-responsibly-from-the-cardano-treasury#:~:text=The%20Cardano%20community%27s%20priority%20is,until%20Ouroboros%20Leios%20is%20implemented)). If that succeeds, even a 10% cut of significantly higher fees and a larger user base could supply ample funding. But until major adoption or scaling improvements (like expected protocol upgrades such as Ouroboros Leios) take effect, the treasury remains highly dependent on the shrinking reserve. Reducing the cut now essentially bets on future ADA price or fee increases to make up for the lost treasury ADA – a gamble contingent on market and adoption outcomes.

## Other Considerations

Beyond the core arguments, there are several secondary factors and nuanced effects to consider:

- **Transaction Fees and Network Usage**: While the treasury cut change does not directly alter transaction fees, it could have indirect implications. If higher staking rewards lead to greater network participation and retention of ADA holders, one might speculate that network activity (and thus fees) could increase over time thanks to a larger, more engaged community. On the other hand, if development slows due to funding cuts, the rollout of fee-generating features or dApps might lag, potentially suppressing future fee growth. There’s also an outside chance that governance might consider adjusting fee parameters in the long run to bolster treasury revenue if it remains low – for instance, increasing fees or redirecting a greater portion of fees to the treasury. Such changes aren’t on the table now, but they illustrate how tightly intertwined Cardano’s economic levers are. Ideally, Cardano’s fees should grow with usage, lessening reliance on the reserve; any decision affecting development funding could indirectly speed up or slow down that transition.

- **Treasury Replenishment Rate**: The rate at which the treasury is refilled each epoch is crucial for its health. Under a 10% regime, replenishment relies on the reserve (monetary expansion) and fees but at half the prior rate. Given that the reserve is designed to **decrease over time**, the replenishment rate is already on a downward trend ([We Must Spend Responsibly From The Cardano Treasury | Cardano Explorer](https://cexplorer.io/article/we-must-spend-responsibly-from-the-cardano-treasury#:~:text=If%20the%20protocol%20parameters%20remain,decreased%20to%203%20million%20ADA)) ([We Must Spend Responsibly From The Cardano Treasury | Cardano Explorer](https://cexplorer.io/article/we-must-spend-responsibly-from-the-cardano-treasury#:~:text=This%20means%2C%20that%20at%20the,decrease%20to%204%2C4%20million%20ADA)). A lower treasury cut accelerates the decline in treasury inflows. This means the community will need to be even more vigilant about how funds are spent. It puts pressure on ensuring that funded projects yield high impact – for example, that they drive network growth or fee increases to compensate for the reduced inflow. The concept of *treasury replenishment* also ties into Catalyst/governance scheduling: with less coming in per epoch, there might be arguments to reduce the frequency or size of funding rounds to maintain a healthy buffer. The community might also explore alternative funding mechanisms (e.g., voluntary contributions, decentralized fundraising for projects) to supplement the treasury if needed. Essentially, a 10% cut forces a closer look at **treasury efficiency** – doing more with less – and places importance on growing other revenue (transaction fees).

- **Incentive Alignment Across Stakeholders**: Different stakeholders in Cardano have varying interests, and this proposal highlights potential misalignments. For ADA *holders and delegators*, more rewards are clearly appealing in the short term. For *stake pool operators (SPOs)*, the change is also welcome on the surface – it increases the total rewards their pools earn, which can help cover operational costs and make smaller pools more viable. However, SPOs and ADA holders also benefit greatly from a flourishing ecosystem (which drives ADA’s value and usage), so they have a long-term interest in treasury-funded growth. *Developers, entrepreneurs, and the Cardano project teams* may lean against the cut because their ability to launch new dApps or improvements could be hampered by fewer grants or slower protocol development funding. *DReps and governance participants* might see both sides: they want to keep constituents (ADA holders) happy with rewards, but they also shoulder the responsibility of budgeting for the ecosystem’s future. The key is aligning these incentives – ideally, decisions should make the network more secure and valuable *and* ensure its growth. Some argue that the current 20/80 split was a reasonable balance (network security was already sufficient with 80% rewards, and 20% funding ensures growth). Others feel that balance should shift slightly now in favor of stakeholders, trusting that the ecosystem can grow organically or that existing funds suffice. It’s a delicate equilibrium to strike. Importantly, any perception that one group benefits at the expense of another could cause friction. For instance, if down the line there’s a funding shortfall, stakeholders might blame those who supported cutting the treasury; conversely, if rewards remain low and ADA price languishes, some might blame conservative economics. Ensuring open communication and perhaps incremental adjustments can help keep all parties aligned in the network’s best interest.

- **Guardrails and Future Flexibility**: As noted, the constitutional guardrails allow this change but set boundaries. One consideration is that by moving to the minimum 10% now, the community leaves no wiggle room to further incentivize staking through this parameter (short of changing the Constitution). If network conditions later warrant an even lower treasury take (unlikely, but hypothetically to fully prioritize staking), that would be off the table without much heavier governance processes. On the flip side, if the cut proves too low, the community can raise it back up (up to 30%) in a future vote – but due to **TC-05 guardrail**, they must wait at least 6 months before doing so ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=TC,1%20%2810)). This built-in delay is to prevent oscillating policies and give the ecosystem time to observe effects. Stakeholders should be aware that whichever direction they go now, it sets a course that cannot be immediately reversed. This raises the stakes for making the *right* call and perhaps suggests caution: if unsure, a smaller change or status quo might be preferable to a drastic swing that could be regretted. In any case, robust monitoring of metrics (staked percentage, treasury balance vs. spend, ADA price, etc.) following the decision will be an important consideration so that the community can react appropriately when the window to adjust opens.

- **Impact on Catalyst and Governance Operations**: The timing of this proposal coincides with Cardano’s transition to on-chain governance (Voltaire). A lot of processes (DRep voting, new committees, etc.) are coming online to manage the treasury and protocol changes. Reducing the treasury cut at this juncture means the first few cycles of on-chain governance will operate under tighter budget growth. This could be seen positively – forcing disciplined budgeting and funding only high-value proposals – or negatively, by limiting what can be attempted in the formative stage of decentralized governance. For example, if there were plans to fund community-driven marketing or large infrastructure projects soon, those plans might need scaling back or delaying if the treasury inflow is less. On the other hand, the existing treasury funds (1.5B ADA) provide a sizable buffer, so in practice the short-term governance budgets (for 2024–2025) might not feel a pinch; the limitation would be felt more in the long run if the trend continues. It’s also worth considering *optics*: a vote to cut the treasury could signal to outside observers that Cardano is prioritizing immediate stakeholder returns, which might attract some investors but could worry others about the commitment to development. The community will want to message clearly whatever outcome occurs – either explaining that the treasury remains ample to achieve Cardano’s roadmap, or that they chose to preserve funding to ensure ambitious growth.

## Recommendations

After weighing the potential upsides and downsides, **caution and balance** are advised in deciding whether to implement this change. The proposal offers a clear benefit – moderately higher staking rewards that could marginally improve participation and network security – but at a significant cost to the treasury’s growth. Given the analysis above, here are the recommendations:

- **Prioritize Long-Term Network Health**: Cardano’s strength lies in its active development and robust community projects. It’s crucial not to undermine the treasury’s ability to fund these. If empirical data or strong community sentiment indicates that a 10% cut will substantially boost engagement without harming growth, it could be worth trying. However, the evidence so far is not conclusive ([DRep VCC Team’s Perspective on the Proposal to Reduce Treasury Cut - General Governance Conversation - Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/drep-vcc-team-s-perspective-on-the-proposal-to-reduce-treasury-cut/143538#:~:text=Image%3A%20%3Apoint_right%3A%20There%20is%20no,and%20analysis%20rather%20than%20assumptions)). Therefore, the safe recommendation is to **approach any reduction conservatively**. An all-at-once drop to the minimum 10% may be too drastic. If increasing staking rewards is a goal, the community might consider a smaller reduction (for example, to 15% treasury cut) as a compromise. This would still boost staking returns (though slightly less), while retaining more funding – a middle path that hedges the risk. Such a modification was not on the ballot this round, but it could be introduced as a follow-up proposal if the 20% vs 10% choice fails to garner consensus.

- **If Implemented, Add Safeguards and Monitoring**: Should the community decide to go forward with the 10% cut, it’s important to put safeguards in place. First, **closely monitor key metrics each epoch** after the change: track the actual staking participation rate, changes in ADA price, treasury inflows, and the rate of treasury spending. If, after a few months, it’s evident that the reduced cut is causing funding stress or if the hoped-for increase in participation/security doesn’t materialize, the community should be ready to course-correct (by raising the cut back to a sustainable level, within the allowed range). The constitutional rule (TC-05) preventing another change for 6 months gives a built-in trial period – use that time to collect data and community feedback. Second, the treasury management strategy might need to adjust: for example, **prioritize high-impact proposals** that can drive adoption or fee revenue (to make up for lower inflows) and avoid committing to expenses that assume endlessly growing treasury funds. Essentially, tighten the belt if needed and focus on investments that yield returns for the ecosystem. Third, consider **contingency funding mechanisms**: if a critical initiative arises that the treasury cannot cover due to the cut, the community might explore alternate funding (such as partnerships, more aggressive Catalyst reallocations, or even temporarily using some of the reserve if absolutely necessary via extraordinary governance measures). Having a contingency plan can alleviate the risk.

- **Community Communication**: Whether the decision is yes or no, clear communication is key. If the treasury cut is reduced, it should be communicated that this is being done to reward participants and that the community remains committed to funding development (with the large existing treasury balance and future fee growth). Emphasize that Cardano is simply optimizing its economics and that important initiatives will **not be starved** in the short term. Conversely, if the decision is to **reject or delay the change**, stakeholders should convey that it’s out of prudence – that Cardano values sustainable growth and will revisit economic adjustments when there’s more data. This can help manage market perceptions and stakeholder expectations, framing the outcome as a thoughtful, data-driven choice rather than a lack of progress.

- **Reevaluate Periodically**: The optimal treasury cut may change over Cardano’s lifecycle. It would be wise to establish a periodic review (perhaps annually or biannually) of economic parameters like treasury cut and monetary expansion. This review can consider the treasury’s balance, the pipeline of funded work, ADA market conditions, and network security status. For instance, if in a year ADA usage has exploded and fees are pouring in, the community might comfortably maintain a lower treasury cut (or even consider lowering again if the constitution is amended). If instead the ecosystem signals that more funding is needed (e.g., many valuable proposals go unfunded), the community could vote to increase the cut within the allowed 10–30% range. By **monitoring and adjusting gradually**, Cardano can find the sweet spot between rewarding its participants and investing in its future. 

**Final Assessment**: On balance, the proposal to reduce the treasury cut to 10% should be treated with caution. The **theoretical benefits** – higher staking incentives, decentralization, and security – are attractive, but they come with **tangible risks** to Cardano’s treasury sustainability and growth capacity. If the community’s sentiment strongly favors immediate rewards and it’s confident existing funds suffice for now, implementing the change with the above safeguards (and a readiness to revert if needed) is reasonable. Otherwise, the wiser course may be to **hold at 20% (or a compromise like 15%) until more data is available** on staking behavior and funding needs. Maintaining network stability and momentum should be the guiding principle. Any change, if adopted, must be accompanied by diligent oversight to ensure Cardano continues to thrive both economically and technically in the long run. 

Ultimately, the decision should align with Cardano’s core vision of sustainable, decentralized growth – balancing the **recognition of contributors** (through fair rewards) with the **collective investment in the ecosystem’s future** ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=,CC%20members%2C%20and%20appropriate%20tokenomics)) ([constitution-converted.md](file://file-UumJ4s2TxwJdH59QCwsjtA#:~:text=,viability%20of%20the%20Cardano%20Blockchain)). The community is now tasked with finding that balance through its governance process, and whichever path it chooses, it should do so united by a commitment to Cardano’s long-term success.
