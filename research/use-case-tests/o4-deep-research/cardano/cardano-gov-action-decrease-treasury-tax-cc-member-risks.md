### **Risk Assessment of the Treasury Cut Proposal (ISO 31000 Framework)**  

Applying **ISO 31000: Risk Management**, we will evaluate the risks associated with reducing the **Cardano treasury cut from 20% to 10%** using the standard **risk assessment criteria**:  

1. **Risk Identification** – Listing potential risks.  
2. **Risk Analysis** – Assessing likelihood and impact.  
3. **Risk Evaluation** – Assigning risk levels and determining if mitigation is required.  
4. **Risk Treatment** – Proposing risk management strategies.

Each risk is rated using a **Likelihood x Impact matrix**, where:  
- **Likelihood (L)**: 1 (Rare) to 5 (Almost Certain)  
- **Impact (I)**: 1 (Negligible) to 5 (Severe)  
- **Risk Score (R = L × I)**  
  - Low (1–5) – Acceptable risk  
  - Medium (6–10) – Needs monitoring  
  - High (12–20) – Requires mitigation  
  - Critical (21–25) – Requires immediate action

## **Risk Register – Treasury Cut Proposal (ISO 31000)**
| **#** | **Risk** | **Likelihood (L)** | **Impact (I)** | **Risk Score (R=L×I)** | **Risk Level** | **Rationale** |
|---|----------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1** | **Treasury underfunding for ecosystem growth** | 4 | 5 | **20** | **High** | Cutting treasury funding by 50% reduces resources for development, marketing, grants, and governance, potentially stalling network growth. |
| **2** | **Governance operations disruption** | 3 | 5 | **15** | **High** | Governance budget (DReps, CC, Catalyst) is sourced from treasury. Halving inflows may require funding cuts, slowing governance evolution. |
| **3** | **Stakeholder dissatisfaction & governance credibility loss** | 3 | 4 | **12** | **High** | Lack of community pre-socialization undermines trust in governance, setting a bad precedent for future proposals. |
| **4** | **Economic unpredictability (staking behavior & rewards impact)** | 4 | 3 | **12** | **High** | No risk assessment was performed to evaluate if increased staking rewards would meaningfully boost participation. |
| **5** | **Precedent for rushed economic decisions** | 3 | 4 | **12** | **High** | If passed without proper analysis, this could encourage more ad-hoc treasury/economic parameter changes, destabilizing long-term governance. |
| **6** | **Future funding uncertainty if ADA price falls** | 3 | 4 | **12** | **High** | Treasury sustainability relies on ADA price appreciation. If price stagnates or falls, the treasury could become severely underfunded. |
| **7** | **Long-term decentralization risk** | 3 | 3 | **9** | **Medium** | Less treasury funding may reduce the ability to support small SPOs and decentralized projects, potentially concentrating power among large actors. |
| **8** | **Delayed infrastructure development** | 2 | 4 | **8** | **Medium** | Infrastructure projects (e.g., Plutus updates, governance tools) rely on treasury funding. Slower treasury growth may delay these. |
| **9** | **Loss of treasury as competitive funding advantage** | 3 | 3 | **9** | **Medium** | Cardano’s treasury is one of the largest among PoS chains. Reducing its intake weakens Cardano’s ability to outcompete rivals in funding dApps and research. |
| **10** | **Lack of risk mitigation mechanisms in the proposal** | 4 | 3 | **12** | **High** | No fail-safe (e.g., sunset clause, review trigger) exists in case the treasury cut proves too extreme. |
| **11** | **Increase in sell pressure due to higher staking rewards** | 3 | 3 | **9** | **Medium** | More ADA in circulation (instead of being locked in the treasury) could increase short-term sell pressure, possibly impacting price stability. |
| **12** | **Community divisiveness and governance instability** | 2 | 3 | **6** | **Medium** | Poor process execution (no consultation, rushed vote) might cause long-term divisions among governance participants. |

## **Risk Evaluation & Recommended Mitigation Measures**

### **Critical/High Risks (Require Immediate Mitigation)**
1. **Treasury underfunding for ecosystem growth (20 – High)**  
   **Mitigation:** Require a fiscal impact study before implementation; introduce phased reduction (e.g., 15% first) instead of a sudden drop.  

2. **Governance operations disruption (15 – High)**  
   **Mitigation:** Conduct a governance budget review to ensure that essential funding (DReps, CC, Catalyst) remains adequate before reducing treasury intake.  

3. **Stakeholder dissatisfaction & governance credibility loss (12 – High)**  
   **Mitigation:** Delay vote and hold a governance workshop for community discussion; revise the proposal to include a risk assessment.  

4. **Economic unpredictability (12 – High)**  
   **Mitigation:** Model how different staking participation rates impact network security and treasury reserves before enacting changes.  

5. **Precedent for rushed economic decisions (12 – High)**  
   **Mitigation:** Establish governance rules requiring economic parameter changes to first go through an "Info" stage for community review.  

6. **Future funding uncertainty if ADA price falls (12 – High)**  
   **Mitigation:** Set up a conditional rollback mechanism: if treasury funds drop below a threshold, the cut is reconsidered.  

7. **Lack of risk mitigation mechanisms in the proposal (12 – High)**  
   **Mitigation:** Amend the proposal to include a “review trigger” (e.g., automatic governance vote to assess impact after 6–12 months).  

---

### **Medium Risks (Require Monitoring & Contingency Planning)**
8. **Long-term decentralization risk (9 – Medium)**  
   **Mitigation:** Ensure treasury grants continue supporting small SPOs and open-source community projects.  

9. **Delayed infrastructure development (8 – Medium)**  
   **Mitigation:** Prioritize critical infrastructure funding in treasury allocation to prevent delays in Cardano’s technical evolution.  

10. **Loss of treasury as a competitive funding advantage (9 – Medium)**  
   **Mitigation:** Develop alternative funding sources (e.g., partnerships, revenue-sharing models) to offset treasury slowdown.  

11. **Increase in sell pressure due to higher staking rewards (9 – Medium)**  
   **Mitigation:** Monitor market impact; if ADA price volatility increases significantly, consider rebalancing treasury inflows.  

12. **Community divisiveness and governance instability (6 – Medium)**  
   **Mitigation:** Improve governance communication channels to address concerns and reinforce a structured decision-making process.

### **Conclusion & Final Recommendation**
- The proposal presents **multiple high-risk factors**, primarily **treasury underfunding, governance disruption, and economic unpredictability**.  
- The **biggest issue** is the **lack of a structured risk mitigation plan** in the proposal itself.  
- **Recommended action:** The Constitutional Committee should **reject the proposal in its current form** and request that it be **revised to include a full fiscal impact assessment, a phased approach, and built-in review mechanisms**.  
- If proponents wish to move forward, **the treasury cut should be reduced incrementally (e.g., from 20% → 15% first), with a mandatory review after 6 months before considering a further cut to 10%.**  

This approach aligns with **ISO 31000’s risk management principles** by ensuring that economic and governance decisions are made **with proper foresight, community input, and safeguards to protect long-term sustainability.**
