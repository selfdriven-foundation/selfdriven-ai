# Discussion Paper: Risks of Not Renewing the Cammeray Golf Course Lease Without a Clear Alternate Plan

## Executive Summary
Council is considering not renewing the lease for the Cammeray Golf Course in 2026. The golf course, managed by NSC, is located on Crown land, and at present, there is no clearly defined alternative plan for its future use. This discussion paper outlines the key risks associated with this course of action. It examines issues related to the management of Crown land, potential impacts on community open space, planning and legal uncertainties, and broader financial and political risks.

## 1. Background
- **Lease Expiry:** The current lease for the Cammeray Golf Course expires in 2026.
- **Crown Land Status:** The land is Crown land, which means NSC acts as the Crown Land Manager with delegated authority from the state. This status brings unique legal and administrative considerations.
- **Lack of Alternate Plan:** NSC has yet to determine a clear, alternative use for the land should the lease not be renewed.
- **Local Council Issues:** NSC faces ongoing challenges including low open space provision, community expectations for transparency, and potential political and financial pressures.

## 2. Key Risks

### 2.1 Loss of Community and Council Control
- **Risk:**  
  With the land being Crown land, there is a heightened risk that the State Government could intervene—possibly negotiating directly with the current leaseholder or another third party—in a manner that bypasses NSC and community input.
- **Implications:**  
  - Reduced local control over how the land is used.
  - Possibility of “secret deals” that do not reflect community interests.
- **Considerations:**  
  NSC’s role as the Crown Land Manager should ideally safeguard public interests; however, without a clear alternate plan, there is a risk that decision-making could shift away from community-driven processes.

### 2.2 Deterioration of Open Space and Community Amenity
- **Risk:**  
  Cammeray Reserve is a major open space asset in North Sydney. Without a robust redevelopment plan that preserves or enhances public greenspace, the non-renewal of the lease could lead to a net loss in usable open space.
- **Implications:**  
  - Reduction in recreational and environmental benefits.
  - Potential conflicts with state infrastructure approvals that mandate a net increase in open space.
- **Considerations:**  
  Open space is already at a premium in North Sydney, and further losses could negatively impact community well-being and property values.

### 2.3 Planning, Legal, and Regulatory Uncertainty
- **Risk:**  
  The absence of a clear alternate use creates a significant planning vacuum. This may lead to future legal disputes and challenges related to rezoning, land use, and environmental compliance.
- **Implications:**  
  - Increased potential for protracted legal challenges that could delay any future redevelopment.
  - Uncertainty in planning outcomes may lead to inconsistent interpretations of Crown land management responsibilities.
- **Considerations:**  
  Robust legal and regulatory frameworks are essential when managing Crown land. A lack of defined planning objectives increases the risk of costly litigation and administrative delays.

### 2.4 Financial and Political Risks
- **Risk:**  
  An undefined future for Cammeray Reserve can generate financial uncertainty, affecting local revenue and property values, and may provoke political backlash from residents.
- **Implications:**  
  - Negative impact on property values and local tax bases.
  - Increased political pressure on NSC from community groups demanding clear, transparent planning.
- **Considerations:**  
  A clear and publicly supported redevelopment strategy is critical to maintaining both fiscal stability and community trust.

## 3. Recommendations

### 3.1 Engage in Comprehensive Community Consultation
- **Action:**  
  - Establish formal channels for stakeholder engagement (e.g., public forums, surveys, advisory committees).
  - Document and publicize all consultations to ensure transparency.
- **Outcome:**  
  This process will help ensure that any future plan reflects community needs and preserves NSC’s local control.

### 3.2 Develop a Robust Master Plan
- **Action:**  
  - Initiate the development of a master plan for Cammeray Reserve that clearly outlines potential alternative uses.
  - Include scenarios that prioritize open space, affordable housing, and recreational facilities.
- **Outcome:**  
  A detailed master plan will reduce legal and planning uncertainties and provide NSC with a strong basis for negotiations with the State Government.

### 3.3 Conduct Legal and Financial Impact Assessments
- **Action:**  
  - Commission legal reviews to evaluate the implications of managing Crown land without a defined alternative use.
  - Undertake detailed financial modeling to assess potential revenue changes, property value impacts, and cost implications.
- **Outcome:**  
  These assessments will inform risk mitigation strategies and support decision-making processes with objective data.

### 3.4 Establish Ongoing Oversight Mechanisms
- **Action:**  
  - Create an oversight committee to monitor the progress of the master plan, manage stakeholder feedback, and update risk assessments regularly.
- **Outcome:**  
  Continuous oversight will help NSC adapt its strategy as conditions evolve and maintain accountability to the community.

## 4. Conclusion
Not renewing the Cammeray Golf Course lease without a clear alternate plan poses significant risks for NSC. These include potential loss of community and council control over Crown land, deterioration of crucial open space, legal and planning uncertainties, and broad financial and political risks. It is imperative that NSC undertake comprehensive community consultations, develop a robust master plan, and perform detailed legal and financial assessments to mitigate these risks and secure a future use that best serves the public interest.
