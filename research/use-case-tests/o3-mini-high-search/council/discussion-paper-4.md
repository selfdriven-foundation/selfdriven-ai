# Discussion Paper  
**Risks and Implications of Not Renewing the Cammeray Golf Club Lease Without an Immediate Alternate Use Plan**

## 1. Executive Summary

This discussion paper examines the risks that may arise if North Sydney Council decides not to renew the Cammeray Golf Club lease when it expires in 2026—and fails to promptly repurpose the land for alternative recreational uses. The analysis highlights significant concerns including the potential for opportunistic land claims, legal and regulatory challenges, financial and operational impacts, and adverse community and political outcomes. In particular, the risk of external parties making a land claim is of critical concern when the asset remains idle. The paper concludes with recommendations to mitigate these risks and maintain community confidence in the Council’s stewardship of public assets.

## 2. Background and Context

- **Asset Overview:**  
  Cammeray Golf Course, managed as Crown land by North Sydney Council, has served as an important recreational facility under a long-term lease with Cammeray Golf Club. The current lease is due to expire in 2026.

- **Current Situation:**  
  The Council is considering a decision not to renew the lease, potentially leaving the 12-hectare asset unused for a significant period if no alternative recreational use is implemented immediately.

- **Community Concerns:**  
  Recent discussions and media reports indicate worries over “secret deals” and a loss of local control over valuable open space. The absence of a clear interim use may heighten community and stakeholder anxieties about how the asset will be managed in the future.

## 3. Key Risks and Issues

### 3.1 Land Claim Risk
- **Description:**  
  With the land left without an active use or clear management plan, there is an increased likelihood that external parties—such as private developers, community or environmental groups, or indigenous stakeholders—could attempt to assert a claim over the land.  
- **Implications:**  
  - **Legal Disputes:** Successful claims could trigger prolonged legal battles, undermining Council authority over the asset.  
  - **Loss of Public Control:** A land claim might result in the land being repurposed in a manner not aligned with community interests.  
- **Discussion Point:**  
  How can the Council proactively assert its stewardship to pre-empt opportunistic claims while exploring alternative uses?

### 3.2 Legal and Regulatory Risks
- **Description:**  
  The idle status of the Crown land may lead to challenges regarding compliance with statutory obligations and proper management under the Local Government Act 1993 and Crown Land Management guidelines.
- **Implications:**  
  - **Increased Scrutiny:** Regulatory bodies or affected stakeholders may question whether the Council is fulfilling its duty to manage the land for the public benefit.  
  - **Litigation and Policy Challenges:** Non-action could invite legal challenges and compel the Council to adopt remedial measures under less favorable conditions.

### 3.3 Financial and Operational Risks
- **Description:**  
  - **Revenue Loss:** The current lease provides a predictable revenue stream, which would be lost if not renewed.  
  - **Cost Increases:** Maintenance and security costs could rise if the land is left unmanaged, and additional resources may be needed to defend against any claims.
- **Implications:**  
  - **Budgetary Pressures:** The loss of income, combined with potential legal costs, could strain the Council’s financial resources.  
  - **Operational Burden:** An idle asset may require increased oversight to prevent vandalism or unauthorized occupation.

### 3.4 Community and Political Risks
- **Description:**  
  - **Community Dissatisfaction:** The golf course is a valued community asset; leaving it unused may lead to public discontent and political fallout.  
  - **Reputational Damage:** Failing to provide a clear future for the asset could undermine public confidence in the Council’s capacity to manage valuable community resources.
- **Implications:**  
  - **Erosion of Trust:** Public criticism might emerge over perceived neglect of open space and recreational assets.
  - **Political Consequences:** Council members may face political pressure if the community feels the asset is being mishandled.

### 3.5 Strategic and External Influences
- **Description:**  
  An absence of a definitive interim plan can create a vacuum that opportunistic external groups may exploit—potentially pushing for a reclassification or lease arrangement that favors their interests over those of the community.
- **Implications:**  
  - **Loss of Local Control:** External pressure could lead to a “land grab” scenario where the asset’s future is decided without adequate community input.  
  - **Precedent Setting:** Failure to manage this asset proactively might set a precedent for similar actions in other parts of the Council’s portfolio.

## 4. Discussion Points for Council Members

- **Balancing Revenue and Community Value:**  
  While the lease provides important revenue, is it in the community’s long-term interest to maintain local control over the land? What trade-offs are acceptable?
  
- **Proactive Land Management:**  
  Should the Council implement an interim use strategy—such as a temporary public recreation facility—to minimize the risk of land claims and preserve the asset’s public value?
  
- **Legal Preparedness:**  
  What legal frameworks and measures can be put in place now to safeguard the asset against opportunistic claims while the Council finalizes a long-term plan?
  
- **Community Consultation:**  
  How can the Council engage with stakeholders—including local residents, indigenous groups, and community organizations—to ensure that any future land use aligns with local needs and expectations?

## 5. Recommendations

Based on the risk analysis, the following recommendations are proposed for Council consideration:

1. **Develop an Interim Use Plan:**  
   Initiate a cost-effective, community-focused temporary use (e.g., a multi-purpose recreational facility or community park) to maintain active management of the land until a final long-term plan is established.

2. **Enhance Security and Maintenance:**  
   Ensure that robust security measures and regular maintenance are implemented to protect the asset from degradation and unauthorized use, thereby reducing the risk of opportunistic land claims.

3. **Engage Stakeholders:**  
   Launch a comprehensive public consultation process to gather input and foster community support, ensuring that the future use of the asset reflects local interests and minimizes external pressures.

4. **Conduct a Legal Review:**  
   Commission a detailed legal analysis to clarify the Council’s obligations under the Crown Land Management framework, and to develop preemptive measures against potential land claims.

5. **Monitor External Developments:**  
   Establish a monitoring mechanism to track any external lobbying or claims on the asset, enabling the Council to respond promptly and assert its management rights.

## 6. Conclusion

Not renewing the Cammeray Golf Club lease without an immediate alternative use plan poses significant risks across legal, financial, operational, and community domains. The potential for opportunistic land claims is especially concerning, as it could lead to a loss of local control and trigger complex legal disputes. By adopting proactive measures—including developing an interim use plan, enhancing asset security, engaging stakeholders, and conducting a thorough legal review—the Council can mitigate these risks and safeguard this valuable community asset.

This discussion paper is intended to provide Council members with a comprehensive overview of the issues at hand and to serve as a basis for informed decision-making regarding the future of Cammeray Golf Course.
