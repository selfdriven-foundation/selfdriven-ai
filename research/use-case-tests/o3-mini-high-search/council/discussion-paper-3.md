# Discussion Paper: Risks of Not Renewing the Cammeray Golf Course Lease Without a Clear Alternate Plan

## Executive Summary
Council is considering not renewing the lease for the Cammeray Golf Course, managed on Crown land, with the lease expiring in 2026. However, a clear alternate plan for the land’s future use has yet to be established. This paper examines the risks associated with this plan of action, taking into account the land’s Crown status, local council challenges, and the requirements and potential implications of the Native Title Act 1996.

## 1. Background
- **Lease and Land Status:**  
  The Cammeray Golf Course operates on Crown land, with NSC serving as the Crown Land Manager. Decisions about its future use carry additional layers of legal and procedural obligations.

- **Lack of an Alternate Plan:**  
  NSC has not yet developed a clear alternative plan for the use of the land if the lease is not renewed. This uncertainty is compounded by other local issues, including limited open space provision and community expectations for transparency.

- **Native Title Considerations:**  
  The Native Title Act 1996 requires that any decision affecting Crown land must consider and, where necessary, involve consultation with traditional owners. This adds another layer of complexity to planning for the future use of the land.

## 2. Key Risks

### 2.1 Loss of Community and Council Control
- **Risk Description:**  
  Without a clearly defined alternative use, there is an increased risk that the State Government might intervene directly, potentially negotiating deals with the current leaseholder or third parties without sufficient input from NSC or the local community.
- **Implications:**  
  - Reduced local control over land management and decision-making.
  - Possibility of “secret deals” that do not reflect the community’s best interests.

### 2.2 Deterioration of Open Space and Community Amenity
- **Risk Description:**  
  Cammeray Reserve is one of North Sydney’s key open space assets. Not having a robust redevelopment or repurposing plan risks reducing both the quantity and quality of greenspace available to residents.
- **Implications:**  
  - Loss of recreational and environmental benefits.
  - Potential conflicts with state infrastructure requirements that mandate a net increase in usable open space.
  
### 2.3 Planning, Legal, and Regulatory Uncertainty
- **Risk Description:**  
  An undefined future use of the land creates significant planning uncertainty. This may result in legal disputes, challenges in rezoning, and conflicts over the proper management of Crown land.
- **Implications:**  
  - Increased potential for costly and protracted legal challenges.
  - Administrative delays and complications in meeting planning and environmental regulations.

### 2.4 Native Title and Cultural Heritage Risks
- **Risk Description:**  
  Under the Native Title Act 1996, any decision affecting Crown land must include proper consultation with traditional owners. If NSC proceeds without fully addressing these obligations, there is a risk of triggering native title claims or legal challenges from indigenous groups.
- **Implications:**  
  - Legal disputes and potential compensation claims if traditional owners’ rights are not adequately considered.
  - Damage to NSC’s reputation and community trust if native title holders are perceived to be excluded from decision-making processes.
  - Future planning restrictions imposed by native title rights that could limit alternate uses of the land.
- **Reference:**  
  The Native Title Act 1996 mandates that Crown land decisions include proper consultation with native title holders to protect their rights and interests.

### 2.5 Financial and Political Risks
- **Risk Description:**  
  Uncertainty about the land’s future use can lead to financial instability and diminished property values. Moreover, political backlash may ensue if the community perceives that local interests have been sidelined.
- **Implications:**  
  - Potential loss of revenue from open space amenities and decreased property values.
  - Political challenges arising from community dissatisfaction and perceptions of non-transparency in land use decisions.

## 3. Recommendations

### 3.1 Engage in Robust Community and Native Title Consultation
- **Actions:**  
  - Establish formal consultation mechanisms that include not only local residents but also representatives of traditional owners.
  - Ensure that all negotiations and decisions are transparent and documented.
- **Outcome:**  
  Increases the legitimacy of any decision taken and minimizes the risk of future legal challenges related to native title.

### 3.2 Develop a Comprehensive Master Plan for the Land
- **Actions:**  
  - Initiate the development of a master plan that explores various viable future uses for Cammeray Reserve.
  - Include options that preserve or enhance open space, provide community amenities, and address potential native title considerations.
- **Outcome:**  
  Provides a clear roadmap that can guide decision-making and reduce planning and legal uncertainties.

### 3.3 Conduct Legal and Financial Impact Assessments
- **Actions:**  
  - Commission detailed legal reviews to ensure compliance with Crown land management obligations and the Native Title Act 1996.
  - Undertake financial modeling to forecast potential revenue impacts, property value changes, and cost implications of various redevelopment scenarios.
- **Outcome:**  
  Equips NSC with objective data to support informed decision-making and risk mitigation.

### 3.4 Establish Ongoing Oversight and Review Mechanisms
- **Actions:**  
  - Form an oversight committee responsible for monitoring the consultation process, master plan development, and implementation of risk mitigation strategies.
  - Schedule regular updates and reviews to adapt to new information or emerging challenges.
- **Outcome:**  
  Ensures continuous community involvement and accountability, while enabling NSC to respond proactively to any evolving risks.

## 4. Conclusion
Not renewing the Cammeray Golf Course lease without a clear alternate plan exposes NSC to significant risks. These include loss of control over Crown land, degradation of a key open space asset, legal and planning uncertainties, potential native title and cultural heritage challenges, and broader financial and political impacts. Addressing these risks through robust consultation, comprehensive planning, and thorough legal and financial assessments is essential to safeguarding community interests and ensuring that any future land use aligns with both statutory obligations and local expectations.
