## 1. Executive Summary

North Sydney Council is considering allowing the Cammeray Golf Club lease to expire in 2026.

- **Current Situation:**  
  Recent council discussions and media coverage have raised concerns over “secret deals” and a loss of community control, as noted in local news reports. These concerns are compounded by the possibility of the land reverting to an idle state if no alternative recreational use is implemented promptly.

- **Importance of Timely Decision-Making:**  
  With open space in North Sydney already under pressure, ensuring that valuable community assets are actively managed is critical. The absence of an immediate alternative use not only affects revenue and maintenance planning but also increases the risk of external claims on the land.

## 3. Risk Identification and Analysis

### 3.1 Land Claim Risk

- **Description:**  
  Leaving the land idle creates a vulnerability that external parties—such as private developers, environmental or community groups, or indigenous stakeholders—might exploit to make a claim or lobby for a change in the asset’s use.
  
- **Implications:**  
  - **Legal Disputes:** Opportunistic claims can lead to prolonged legal battles, forcing the Council into defending its stewardship in court.  
  - **Loss of Local Control:** A successful claim may result in the land being reclassified or repurposed in a manner that does not serve community interests.
  
- **Likelihood & Impact:**  
  **Medium to High likelihood** if the asset remains unused; **High impact** due to potential legal and reputational costs.
  
- **Supporting Context:**  
  Media reports and council discussions have noted fears of “secret deals” and opportunistic actions regarding Crown land management.

### 3.2 Legal and Regulatory Risks

- **Description:**  
  As a Council-managed Crown land asset, Cammeray Golf Course must be maintained for public benefit under the Local Government Act and Crown Land Management guidelines. Failure to provide an active use could be interpreted as mismanagement or neglect of statutory obligations.
  
- **Implications:**  
  - **Increased Scrutiny:** Regulatory bodies or affected parties may question whether the Council is meeting its legal responsibilities.  
  - **Potential Litigation:** Legal challenges may arise from community groups or other stakeholders, forcing remedial actions under less favorable terms.
  
- **Likelihood & Impact:**  
  **Medium likelihood**; **Medium to high impact** on operational and legal fronts.
  
- **Relevant Details:**  
  The legal framework for managing Crown lands imposes clear obligations; non-action could trigger both regulatory intervention and judicial scrutiny.

### 3.3 Financial Risks

- **Description:**  
  - **Revenue Loss:** The lease provides a stable income stream, and its non-renewal would remove this revenue.  
  - **Maintenance Costs:** An idle asset might require increased spending on security and upkeep to prevent vandalism or degradation.
  
- **Implications:**  
  - **Budgetary Pressure:** Reduced income and potential unexpected costs (e.g., legal fees) can strain the Council’s finances.  
  - **Opportunity Cost:** Funds that might have supported alternative community projects may need to be diverted to manage issues arising from an unused asset.
  
- **Likelihood & Impact:**  
  **High likelihood** for revenue loss; **Medium impact** operationally and financially.

### 3.4 Operational Risks

- **Description:**  
  An asset without a defined use is prone to neglect, unauthorized occupation, or vandalism. The absence of active management increases the risk of the property deteriorating.
  
- **Implications:**  
  - **Asset Degradation:** Without regular use and monitoring, the condition of the land may decline, complicating future redevelopment.  
  - **Management Challenges:** Increased resource allocation may be needed to secure and maintain the land, diverting attention from other Council projects.
  
- **Likelihood & Impact:**  
  **Medium likelihood**; **Medium impact** in terms of operational challenges and additional costs.

### 3.5 Community and Political Risks

- **Description:**  
  The golf course is not only a recreational facility but also a community landmark. Its underuse or mismanagement could provoke public dissatisfaction and political backlash.
  
- **Implications:**  
  - **Loss of Public Trust:** The community may perceive the Council as neglecting a valuable public asset, leading to reduced confidence in local governance.  
  - **Political Fallout:** Councillors might face criticism and electoral repercussions if the asset’s future is not clearly managed.
  
- **Likelihood & Impact:**  
  **High likelihood**; **High impact** in terms of reputational damage and potential political consequences.
  
- **Supporting Information:**  
  Concerns over the future of Cammeray Reserve have been widely discussed within Council meetings and reported by local media.

### 3.6 Strategic and External Influences

- **Description:**  
  The absence of an immediate, clear alternative use plan may allow external parties to influence or determine the future use of the land—potentially in ways that do not align with community values.
  
- **Implications:**  
  - **Precedent Setting:** Failure to act decisively may embolden similar moves on other Council-managed assets.  
  - **Shift in Policy Direction:** External lobbying could shift the balance away from community benefit toward private interests or non-recreational uses.
  
- **Likelihood & Impact:**  
  **Medium to High likelihood** if the asset remains idle; **High impact** on long-term strategic control over public land.

## 6. Conclusion and Recommendations

Not renewing the Cammeray Golf Club lease without immediately repurposing the land exposes North Sydney Council to multiple high-level risks. The potential for opportunistic land claims is particularly significant and could result in protracted legal disputes, loss of local control, and adverse impacts on community trust and financial stability. 

**Recommendations for Council:**

1. **Develop and Implement an Interim Use Plan:**  
   Activate the asset with a temporary recreational or community-focused use to maintain engagement and deter external claims.

2. **Increase Asset Security and Maintenance:**  
   Allocate additional resources for the ongoing care of the land to prevent deterioration and misuse.

3. **Undertake a Comprehensive Legal Review:**  
   Ensure that all statutory obligations are met and that robust legal measures are in place to defend against potential claims.

4. **Engage Stakeholders Proactively:**  
   Launch a transparent consultation process to incorporate community views and reinforce the asset’s public value.

5. **Monitor External Influences:**  
   Establish a dedicated monitoring mechanism to detect and respond to any early attempts by external parties to claim or repurpose the land.

By taking these steps, the Council can mitigate the identified risks and secure the future of this vital community asset while maintaining robust control over its use and management.
