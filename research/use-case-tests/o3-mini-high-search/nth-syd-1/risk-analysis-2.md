This document presents an analysis of the risks associated with North Sydney Council’s (NSC) plan not to renew the Cammeray Golf Course lease in 2026—without a clear alternate plan of use for the Crown land. The analysis identifies key risk areas, evaluates their likelihood and potential impact, and outlines suggested mitigation strategies. This information is intended to assist NSC in making an informed, proactive decision.

## 2. Detailed Risk Analysis

### 2.1 Loss of Community Control
- **Description:**  
  The Crown land status of Cammeray Reserve increases the risk that decision-making may shift from NSC to the State Government if negotiations occur without adequate community input.
- **Likelihood:** High  
- **Impact:** High  
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Set up a robust consultation process involving community stakeholders.  
  - Form an advisory committee that reviews any proposals involving the land.
- **Monitoring:**  
  Regular public reporting on negotiation processes and outcomes.

### 2.2 Deterioration of Open Space
- **Description:**  
  Without a clear alternate plan, there is a danger that any redevelopment could diminish the amount or quality of open space—a key asset in North Sydney with already low per capita availability.
- **Likelihood:** Medium  
- **Impact:** High  
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Develop a comprehensive master plan that prioritizes maintaining or improving the quality of open space.  
  - Align redevelopment proposals with state requirements for net increases in usable greenspace.
- **Monitoring:**  
  Periodic environmental impact assessments and open space audits.

### 2.3 Planning and Legal Uncertainty
- **Description:**  
  A lack of clear planning objectives increases the potential for legal challenges, rezoning disputes, and delays in the decision-making process.
- **Likelihood:** Medium  
- **Impact:** Medium–High  
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Consult with legal experts to clarify all implications of managing Crown land without a defined alternate use.  
  - Prepare contingency plans for potential legal disputes.
- **Monitoring:**  
  Ongoing legal reviews and updates from planning authorities.

### 2.4 Financial and Political Risks
- **Description:**  
  Uncertainty about the future use of the land may lead to reduced property values, decreased community revenue from open space benefits, and political dissatisfaction.
- **Likelihood:** High  
- **Impact:** High  
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Undertake a thorough financial impact analysis to inform future revenue projections.  
  - Develop a clear communications strategy to address community concerns and manage political expectations.  
  - Investigate alternative revenue streams that could compensate for any shortfalls.
- **Monitoring:**  
  Regular financial performance reviews and stakeholder feedback sessions.

## 3. Conclusion
The non-renewal of the Cammeray Golf Course lease without a clear alternate plan presents significant risks for NSC. These include loss of community control over Crown land, deterioration of a vital open space asset, legal and planning uncertainties, and substantial financial and political challenges. By proactively addressing these risks through comprehensive community engagement, robust master planning, early legal and financial reviews, and ongoing monitoring, NSC can safeguard community interests and ensure that future land use decisions are both sustainable and publicly accountable.
