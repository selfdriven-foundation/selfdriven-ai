# Discussion Paper: Risks of Not Renewing the Cammeray Golf Course Lease Without a Clear Alternative Use

## Executive Summary
This paper outlines the key risks associated with North Sydney Council’s potential decision not to renew the Cammeray Golf Course lease in the absence of a well‐defined alternative plan for the land. The risks span community control, open space quality, planning and legal uncertainty, and financial and political implications. It is intended to guide council deliberations by highlighting areas for further consultation and strategic planning.

## 1. Background
North Sydney Council currently leases part of Cammeray Reserve—the largest single parcel of open space in the local government area—to the Cammeray Golf Club. With the lease set to expire in May 2026, there is growing discussion about not renewing the lease. However, no clear alternative plan for the land’s future use has been established, which raises several risks:
- The possibility of secretive negotiations with the current leaseholder or third parties.
- Potential deterioration in the quality or quantity of open space.
- Uncertainty in planning outcomes and legal challenges.
- Financial risks that could affect both community amenity and council revenue.

## 2. Discussion of Risks

### 2.1 Loss of Community Control
- **Issue:**  
  There is a strong concern that, in the absence of a transparent, community-driven plan, the State Government might negotiate a deal directly with the Cammeray Golf Club or another third party without adequate consultation.
- **Implications:**  
  This could result in the land being repurposed in a manner that does not reflect local priorities or community needs.
- **Reference:**  
  Local media and council discussions have raised fears about “secret deals” bypassing community input. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### 2.2 Deterioration of Open Space
- **Issue:**  
  Cammeray Reserve is a critical open space in North Sydney, particularly given the area’s low provision of greenspace per head.
- **Implications:**  
  Without a well-considered alternative use, any redevelopment might reduce the available greenspace or diminish its quality, potentially conflicting with state infrastructure approvals that mandate a net increase in usable open space.
- **Reference:**  
  Council documents emphasize that preserving and enhancing open space is a key priority for community wellbeing. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### 2.3 Planning and Legal Uncertainty
- **Issue:**  
  An undefined future for the land creates significant uncertainty regarding planning outcomes.
- **Implications:**  
  This ambiguity can lead to protracted legal challenges and planning disputes, which may strain council resources and delay beneficial redevelopment.
- **Discussion:**  
  Without a definitive plan, conflicts may arise between the council’s vision, state government priorities, and community expectations, leading to potential litigation and unpredictable regulatory environments.

### 2.4 Financial and Political Risks
- **Issue:**  
  The uncertainty surrounding the land’s future use can have broad financial implications.
- **Implications:**  
  - **Financial:** A poorly planned redevelopment may negatively impact property values and reduce long-term revenue from public amenities.
  - **Political:** Community dissatisfaction over uncommunicated or unsatisfactory redevelopment outcomes could erode trust in the council, influencing local political stability and future elections.
- **Discussion:**  
  Political backlash and financial instability could result from missed opportunities to optimize the land for community benefit, thereby affecting the council’s ability to meet broader urban planning goals.

## 3. Recommendations
To address these risks, the following steps are recommended:

- **Comprehensive Community Consultation:**  
  Initiate a robust engagement process to involve local stakeholders in discussions about the future use of Cammeray Reserve. This will help ensure that any proposed alternative aligns with community needs and values.

- **Development of a Master Plan:**  
  Prioritize the creation of a master plan that outlines potential uses for the land—including options that preserve or enhance open space, provide affordable housing, and offer recreational opportunities. This plan should be developed in close consultation with urban planners, legal advisors, and community representatives.

- **Legal and Regulatory Assessment:**  
  Work with legal experts to evaluate potential planning challenges and ensure that any new lease or redevelopment proposal complies with local, state, and environmental regulations. Proactive legal review will mitigate future uncertainties and disputes.

- **Financial Impact Analysis:**  
  Conduct a detailed financial assessment to understand the implications of alternative uses, including impacts on property values and long-term revenue. Consider risk mitigation strategies that safeguard community and council interests.

- **Mechanisms for Ongoing Community Oversight:**  
  Establish frameworks that enable continued community involvement in decision-making processes related to the land. This could include advisory committees or public reporting mechanisms to maintain transparency and trust.

## 4. Conclusion
Not renewing the Cammeray Golf Course lease without a clear, viable alternative plan presents multiple risks. These include the potential loss of community control over land use, a reduction in valuable open space, significant planning and legal uncertainties, and adverse financial and political outcomes. By undertaking comprehensive consultation, developing a strategic master plan, and addressing legal and financial challenges proactively, North Sydney Council can better ensure that the future use of Cammeray Reserve aligns with community interests and supports sustainable urban development.
