## 2. Detailed Analysis of Native Title and Related Risks

### 2.1 Native Title & Cultural Heritage Risks

- **Risk Description:**  
  The Native Title Act 1996 requires that decisions affecting Crown land include proper consultation with traditional owners. Failing to do so may trigger native title claims or disputes, undermine community trust, and introduce delays in the redevelopment process.  
- **Likelihood:** Medium  
- **Impact:** High  
- **Implications:**  
  - **Legal Challenges:** If native title holders are not adequately consulted, there may be legal claims that delay or disrupt future redevelopment.  
  - **Reputational Damage:** Perceptions of excluding traditional owners can harm NSC’s credibility and public trust.  
  - **Planning Restrictions:** Future planning decisions may be constrained by native title rights, reducing flexibility in land use options.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**  
  - **Early and Inclusive Consultation:** Engage with traditional owners and representatives early in the planning process, ensuring that their rights and interests are central to any decision-making.  
  - **Compliance Documentation:** Ensure all consultation processes are thoroughly documented and aligned with the requirements of the Native Title Act 1996.  
  - **Integrated Master Plan:** Incorporate native title considerations into the master plan, with clear provisions that respect cultural heritage and provide for ongoing engagement.
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Regular reviews of consultation records and progress reports by the NSC Legal and Governance Teams.  
  - Establish a dedicated Indigenous Consultation Officer to monitor compliance and follow up on native title issues.

### 2.2 Other Related Risks

- **Loss of Community & Council Control:**  
  Without a clear plan, the risk increases that decision-making may be transferred to state-level negotiations or third-party agreements that bypass local input.  
- **Deterioration of Open Space:**  
  An undefined future use might lead to redevelopment that reduces valuable greenspace, impacting recreation, environmental quality, and community well-being.
- **Planning, Legal & Regulatory Uncertainty:**  
  Unclear land use strategies can provoke disputes and delays, complicating compliance with both local planning regulations and Crown land management requirements.
- **Financial & Political Risks:**  
  Uncertainty and lack of transparency may reduce property values, diminish revenue opportunities, and lead to political challenges from an increasingly engaged community.

## 3. Conclusion

The decision not to renew the Cammeray Golf Course lease without a clear alternate plan poses a series of interconnected risks. In particular, the obligations under the Native Title Act 1996 introduce additional complexity, requiring robust consultation with traditional owners to avoid legal disputes and protect cultural heritage. By addressing these risks through comprehensive planning, legal and financial assessments, and active stakeholder engagement—including dedicated native title consultations—NSC can better safeguard public interests and secure a sustainable future for Cammeray Reserve.
