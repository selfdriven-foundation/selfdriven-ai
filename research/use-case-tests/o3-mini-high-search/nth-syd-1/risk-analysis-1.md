## Detailed Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Loss of Community Control
- **Risk Detail:**  
  Without a clear alternative plan, there is concern that decision-making could bypass community consultation, leading to “secret deals” with the leaseholder or third parties.
- **Mitigation Measures:**  
  - **Community Consultation:** Establish a formal and transparent process for stakeholder engagement (e.g., public forums, surveys, and advisory groups).
  - **Documentation & Reporting:** Ensure that all decision-making steps and negotiations are publicly documented and communicated.
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Regular review of community feedback and meeting minutes.
  - Assign the Community Engagement Committee to oversee stakeholder input.

  Concerns over non-transparent negotiations have been noted in local media discussions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### 2. Deterioration of Open Space
- **Risk Detail:**  
  Cammeray Reserve, a critical greenspace in North Sydney, may lose value if redevelopment reduces its area or degrades its quality.
- **Mitigation Measures:**  
  - **Master Plan Development:** Prioritize creating a master plan that incorporates options for maintaining or enhancing greenspace.
  - **Compliance with State Mandates:** Integrate requirements from state infrastructure approvals that demand a net increase in usable open space.
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Conduct periodic environmental impact assessments.
  - Use urban planning metrics to evaluate open space quality post-decision.
- **Reference:**  
  The need to maintain sufficient open space is a recurring theme in council documents. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### 3. Planning and Legal Uncertainty
- **Risk Detail:**  
  An unclear future for the land increases the chance of legal challenges and planning disputes, which can delay or derail redevelopment projects.
- **Mitigation Measures:**  
  - **Legal and Regulatory Review:** Engage legal experts to assess lease and planning obligations and preempt potential disputes.
  - **Contingency Planning:** Develop clear contingency plans to address possible legal challenges.
  - **Coordination with Regulators:** Maintain active dialogue with state and local regulatory bodies.
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Schedule regular legal audits and consult with planning advisors.
  - Ensure updates from regulatory agencies are reviewed periodically.
  
### 4. Financial and Political Risks
- **Risk Detail:**  
  Uncertainty over the land’s future use may negatively impact property values and public revenue, leading to political backlash and reduced community trust.
- **Mitigation Measures:**  
  - **Financial Impact Assessment:** Undertake detailed financial modelling to project revenue outcomes and assess long-term fiscal impacts.
  - **Strategic Communication:** Develop a clear communication strategy to manage stakeholder expectations and address political concerns.
  - **Alternative Revenue Models:** Investigate innovative revenue options and public-private partnerships that safeguard community interests.
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Track financial performance indicators and adjust models as needed.
  - Engage regularly with community and political stakeholders through public forums and updates.

## Conclusion
By identifying these four key risk areas and implementing robust mitigation strategies, North Sydney Council can better manage the uncertainties surrounding the potential non-renewal of the Cammeray Golf Course lease. Proactive risk management will not only protect the community’s access to valuable open space but also ensure that any future decision aligns with legal, financial, and political best practices.
